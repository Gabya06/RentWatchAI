Median asking rent varies a lot by neighborhood. When you hear the 4k number thats mostly because of Manhattan.

Even some relatively trendy places are well under 2500$  like Astoria. Place like East Village, Upper East Side, park slop, bushwick seem to be right at 2500$.\n2. New York the sweet spot for renting is actually a 3 bedroom. Basically most people working ordinary jobs have to have room mates. For example astoria is 2100 for a studio and 3600 for  a 3 bedroom,  Bushwick is 3600 as well.\n3. One and Two Bedrooms seem to be generally bad value propositions. Basically they are luxuries.\n\nI am basing this on January data, but trends hold  over time. TLDR, people that make 80 to 100k can afford the median studios in many neighborhoods. There are several neighborhoods where 3 room mates can afford the median a 3 or more bedroom apartments as long as they each make 50k to 60k.

New York City gives tenants a 5-day grace period before late fees can be assessed, and those fees are capped at either $50 or 5% of the monthly rent, whichever is lower.\n* **#12 (Tenants pay for stuck toilets and sinks)**: This clause is vague. What exactly does ""stuck"" mean? If a toilet malfunctions because of something you did—like flushing wads of Bounty or Huggies—you might be responsible. But if it’s a regular malfunction, the landlord is typically obligated to fix it due to the implied warranty of habitability.\n\nIt seems like the landlord might be frustrated due to issues with past tenants, but that doesn’t absolve them of their legal responsibilities. Sometimes, landlords throw in these kinds of provisions, hoping tenants won’t challenge them. If any disputes arise, make sure to question the ones that don\'t seem normal before handing over any money.\n\nIf you were shown these terms only after signing the lease, you might want to contest their validity. A contract requires a ""meeting of the minds"" to be binding, and these provisions WOULD have influenced your decision to enter into the lease. Also, the document looks hastily put together—definitely not something you’d expect from a professional lease agreement.

In fact since the pandemic most listings I was interested in just had a lock box to see it alone and somehow I still had to pay a fee.', 'Again!? Yay!', 'Professional tenants and scumbag tenants are a reason brokers have a job. Its cheaper to outsource the due diligence than risk any one of those two scenarios.', 'I have to pay a weeks worth of rent on a one month supply and get this the broker didn’t even show up one of the porters are show us the unit', 'That is definitely going to come back to tenants.', 'This comes up every year or so as the broker fee issue does suck but the real issue is the vacancy rate \n\nIt’s a bandaid solution that only works if you as a tenant are only staying for the initial lease period. If you move every year or only are here for a year then this all makes sense. \n\nThe shift is when you stay longer. And most units rent for 2-3yrs. The problem is that the fee can get baked into the rent but when you renew the rent doesn’t adjust down bc there’s no fee to pay now.  \n\nSay a unit is 2400 w a tenant paid fee but owner raises it to 2600 to pay for the broker fee & since you don’t want to pay a fee, you shift funds around & go with the 2600 unit\n\n2600 owner paid fee, so net rent is 2400 for that owner for that first year. \n\nBut say you stay a second year, even w no increase in rent, you’ve now paid that 2400 broker fee again. \n\nA 15% fee on a 2400 is 4320\nPaying an extra 2400 each year would be 4800\n\nAnd if you stayed a third year w no rent increase then you’ve now paid an extra 7200\n\nIf that same 2400 unit is tenant paid (at a 1mo rate) so the net rent for you is now 2600 for the first year essentially the same as owner paying the fee on a 2600 apartment. \n\nStay a second year (assuming no increase) & your net rent over the 24mos is now 2500. Stay a third year & net rent to you is now 2467 over 36months. The one time fee erodes the longer you stay in the unit. \n\nOR say the market rate for the same unit is 2400 & increasing the rent to cover the broker fee won’t move it. So owner does 2400 for the first year. Pays a broker fee so net rent to owner is 2200. If you renew, I could see an owner doing a $200 increase to cover that fee from the first year so now your rent goes to 2600. And the law says if you’ve been in the unit for less than 12mos, you only get 30 days notice. Every owner will wait till the last second before sending that increase. So it’s either you decided to move within 30 days which is its own amount of work & cost & time. Or you bite the bullet & pay the increase. \n\nSo now that fee you avoided paying in the first year gets recouped in the second year. And if you stay a third year & there’s no increase from 2600, you’ve paid the 2400 fee again which is more than a 15% one time fee. \n\nAnd what I can 100% see happening is brokers will show these units & tell folk that there’s a rent if you pay the fee & a rent if the owner pays the fee and if there’s multiple apps on a unit then someone might even offer to pay the broker fee & pay the owner paid rent rate to beat out the others. \n\nI know in others places the owner pays the fee always but the vacancy rate there is much higher so tenants have more to chose from. But our vacancy rate is like 2.4%\n\nThe only thing that will fix broker fee issues is the build more housing. And build more actual mid tier affordable housing, not constant giant luxury projects. \n\nWithout more units the vacancy rate will stay low & the problem will get worse. \n\nBroker fees suck. Brokers are mostly horrible. But when there is a major demand & limited supply, these one time fees make more financial sense for a tenant over time.', ""Yeah, this won't come back to bite us on the ass like the cap on renovations and vacancy increases on ret stabilized apartments.\n\nIt won't make a difference for Market Rate apartments, LL are charging the maximum rent they can get away with, and they'll have leverage with brokers to get better rates. Renters will still get screwed somehow, paying fees before they can even look at an apartment, exclusive contracts, etc...  \n\nRent Stabilized apartments will be worse. You are now telling a LL that not only can he only rent the apartment for 40% below market, needs to take a loss on any improvements made,  but now he'll need to pay a fee to get somebody to live in it? This is going to open up a world of abuse that makes the $15,000 broker fee the good old days."", 'The broker fee will just be added to the rent and the tenants pay higher rent. \n\nThis is worse if you understand math… \nJust making a valid point don’t kill the messenger!! \n\nExample With Broker Fee - \n\nRent is $1000/m for easy math. \n\n$1000 x 12 = $12,000 \nBroker fee 15% = $1800 \nYearly rent = $13,800 \n\n2nd year - Rent Went up $100\nRent for the year - $13,200 \nBecause rent only goes up on the actual rent amount not the extra fee added. \n\n\nExample With Broker Fee Added in Rent -\nRent - $1000 x 12 + $1800(fee) = $13,800\nBroker Fee - $1800 - Added to monthly rent \nMonthly rent total - $1150 \n\n2Nd Year - Rent Went Up $100 same \nRent For 2nd year - $15,000. \n\nWhen the fee is added you pay the second year at the higher. That makes a difference $1800 the second year and gets bigger each year making the one-time fee apartment way better long term.\n\nAdd On: I’m literally showing just the math and getting attacked by a bunch of idiots that don’t understand how a free market works or it’s a choice to rent or use a broker. \n\nDownvote all you want but it’s cheaper to use a broker if you plan to stay more than 2 years. Just some advice to help! \nDownvote because you can’t change or control the facts. I don’t care!', 'Im a broker. Save the hate please. Im just a regular guy trying to make a living and I’m not “rolling in dough” by any means.  I get the broker fee hate too. NYC is expensive! Plus there are asshole brokers that simply don’t care.  Assholes are everywhere! Lol\n\nAs a tenant your interaction with a broker may be limited, but their work does not start and end with you.  It’s often weeks of work to rent an apartment.  There’s also the cost of listing on StreetEasy which is $7 every day it’s listed, photographs, floor plans, etc. \n\nAnd landlords 100% raise the rent when listing a no fee apartment.  They often have a number in mind based on previous rent and expenses and if they pay a fee as well they totally bake it into the rent. We can advise on market rent, but even we are often surprised when the market drives the price above where we thought it would go. \n\nI do think that the landlord should be required to at least share the fee with the tenant as they both have a vested interest.  One looking for a qualified tenant and the other looking for quality apartment.', 'If this does happen (even though it probably won’t, they’ve already tried this) it just means your rent is going to increase way more.  \n\nYou’re not going to save any money by this, you might even end up paying more than you would have. It’s just less money up front but rent prices alone will increase more than they would otherwise. \n\nThis isn’t the solution that they think it is - they should focus on other problems (like apartments sitting there vacant - fine the owners) but I guess time will tell! \n\nThere are so many things that they could come up with to better New Yorkers and make the process simpler… but they bring this up like every year just so it makes it seem like they’re doing something so they get reelected. It’s a topic they’re “continuing to fight for” even though it’ll never change.']"

Lots of people will live in multiple-income households one way or another. And they hunt for deals and pounce on them immediately. And of course, dual or more incomes help a lot compared to a single income.\n\nMy first and longest-occupied apartment in NYC was a large one-bedroom in a rent-stabilized 1920\'s pre-war elevator tenement building in Brooklyn. It usually didn\'t have cockroaches or mice, and it was pretty large, good light, on the top floor, and in reasonable condition, so I loved it. However, it was pretty crappy by anywhere-else standards. Plus they\'re hard to get into. I got very lucky.\n\nMy wife and I live in a less-than-20-year-old condo-style building now, and it\'s nice and affordable for our income today, but it was a very, very lucky find. The broker half-joked that she loved showing this apartment because it was actually adult-sized.\n\nMost of our friends are pretty reasonably paid professionals, lots of couples, and my wife and I are the closest to living in a ""luxury"" new build of anyone at this point. Friends live in older tenement-style buildings or partial brownstones.\n\nThe older the stock gets, the more it tends to be adult-livable and was better constructed. A lot of this is survivorship bias as much as anything... anything built to very low standards a hundred years ago was probably knocked down fifty years ago.\n\n>*Hopefully this city gets it together and eventually starts building way more apartments (with actually livable floor plans).*\n\nYeah, I hope so. In the meantime dig around in Queens and Brooklyn for something older. Make a list of your must-haves and dealbreakers and focus on things other people hate that you don\'t mind.\n\nWhen my wife and I started dating she had a nice deal on a one-bedroom by herself because it was on the sixth floor of a non-elevator building. I had a goth friend who lived in Manhattan long ago and really liked living in a dark cave, so she got a good deal on a low-floor courtyard apartment. Given the timeframe, they were both making around today\'s equivalent of $80k taking inflation into account.  Was still tough for both of them given the pay at the time, but they made it work living alone.\n\nWhen I first moved here, the broker showed me a similar dark-cave ground-floor interior apartment for like 2/3 the price of the one I eventually lived in. But that was a dealbreaker for me.\n\nIf you make significantly less than $80k in today\'s dollars, and are just moving to NYC, I think many people are looking at roommates/housemates, family (living with them or getting help from), or incredible luck.\n\nMy first building was full of retirees and working people who could afford their rent-stabilized places partially because they\'d been there a long, long time. I think my next-door neighbor had lived there for 45 years and raised her kids there. She was a retired emergency-room nurse.\n\nRent stabilization/control is a good thing IMO, for long-term life, but yeah, we also need significant up-market construction of good quality housing to take the pressure off for people who want to move here now.', 'This is why you always want to find an apt in a pre war building.

Absolutely ludicrous. \n\nAll together, for an apartment that was $3,300 in rent (already absurd), the upfront costs were almost $10,000. \n\nWe opted to stay in our smaller apartment and deal with it. \n\nTo add onto all of this: we’ve lived in NYC almost ten years now, and have moved 3 times.

I’d offer that this can be simplified to a set of basic principles which apply in any hot market (jobs, home sales and rentals, cars, etc):\n\n1. Be a good human. Whether you’re dealing with a faceless corporate office, real estate agent, or self-managing landlord, you’re dealing with or through an individual person with agency over your outcome. Be courteous, pleasant, and respectful of their time.\n\n2. Be timely. Inquire as soon as you discover a potential rental. Have your documentation ready to produce on demand. Reply immediately to communications. Take the earliest showing you can get. You can’t control how quickly others jump on the listing but if/when you have the rental agent’s attention, you want to capitalize on that to make as much progress as possible, as quickly as possible, to move yourself down the funnel.\n\n3. Communicate clearly. Write well. Use spellcheck.  Structure your email or text for legibility. Introduce yourself and lead with your ask(s). Anticipate follow up questions to eliminate extra back-and-forth. Household income, credit score, dates, roommates, pets… you can wait to be asked or you can proactively offer the key criteria the agent needs to qualify you as a candidate. End with next steps- do you want to schedule a walkthrough, submit an application, have a quick call?\n\n4. Make their day. This is a strategy built upon the above principles. You want to close a deal? Want to get good service? Want a job? Don’t make the other party work harder to benefit you. Put in the effort to make helping you, easier for them. Work with their schedule. Be organized. Be kind. Do not lay your burdens upon them but accept theirs.

You can\'t have a case where you the have lowest vacancy rate in history (which we do) and you still want the rest of the apartments available to be cheap. It doesn\'t work like that, you can nationalize housing and make them all cheap and stablized but then you simply won\'t ever get an apartment in new york cause they will all be taken already without more housing to supply everyone that wants one.\n\nThis isn\'t an apartment hunting question but more of a political (and philosophical) one because in theory no place is on the scale of new york and has had 100% nationalized housing, and it probably just wont happen. You are trading in allocation of resources from money to being on a system of first come first serve basis, which ""ruins"" the purpose of why people have and make money. I\'m not saying that\'s good or bad just that you have to convince everyone to stop capitalism and especially stop tying in wealth to real estate and property, to nationalize all housing would mean convincing pretty much every American that their house value should no longer go up, good luck with that considering most Americans have all of their wealth tied up to their house. And while that MIGHT lower the rent, you still have to deal with the fact that everyone wants to live in New York and there is a shortage of units, you either force people to move out, or you allow for laxer zoning.

It just makes it more expensive. Wishful thinking can not change economic reality. The bottom line is NYC needs to change the laws to make it more favorable for developers to buy and build apartments. Until that’s done, you’re just going to see things get worse. No matter how good of an idea more socialist housing policies seem, they are not going to work. That’s what got us into this mess. The demand just outstrips supply far too much. The city needs millions more housing units and that’s not going to happen without incentive. You can cry and whine and blame developers and landlords all you want but that doesn’t change reality and it never will. There is tons of research that shows what has to happen to make rents more affordable - more apartments need to be built and that just isn’t going to happen without the possibility for a return on investment.

That means fixing zoning, incentivizing developers to build the types of units the market works.\n\nThe whole problem in the U.S. since 2008 has been under construction of housing in general. New York is the worst case of it. No its not just your landlord that's causing it. Its the also current owners that vote for things that prevent new construction, special interests etc.\n\nNo more rent stabilization isn't the solution. Rents would be stabilized if construction kept up with demand. However, artificially rent stabilizing prevents construction, because at some point the rent falls below the cost of actually making repairing apartment. They disincentivize construction, because the cost of building/financing a project isn't worth it.\n\nIf NYC wants to seriously fix it issues it needs to do the policies that are outlined in reports like this one (Rand is a highly respected non-partisan think tank)\n\nSee: [https://www.rand.org/pubs/research\\_reports/RRA2775-1.html](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA2775-1.html)\n\nThis explicitly looks at NYC and it compares it to a similar size/ density city that has these policies (Tokyo) that doesn't have a construction problem."", 'So apartments in NYC should be first come first serve?

Hopefully I can provide some context as to why the fees are the way they are.\n\nFirst of all, there should be a lot of work and expense that goes into listing a property.\n\nHere are a few of the things I do when I list a property:\n\n\\* Look at dozens of comps to understand the market value of the property.\n\n\\* Have extensive discussions with owners to offer competitive rental rates. Owners are sometimes unrealistic about the value of their units and this can generate a lot of back and forth and require a lot of additional research on my end.\n\n\\* Hire professional photographers and floor plan experts to shoot the property and t it in the best light while also providing lots of context to potential renters.\n\n\\* Set up multiple open houses and accommodate as many showings as possible. I could show a property dozens of times before it is rented.\n\n\\* Interact with every interested applicant over the phone and via email. Many applicants come direct (i.e. without their own agents), so I spend upwards of an hour just explaining the process to each of them.\n\n\\* Review each application. Ask for additional required documentation if necessary.\n\n\\* Guide the tenant through the board application process. Provide them resources on writing high quality referral letters and accurately portraying their financials.\n\n\\* Follow up with the management company every few days to make sure the application is moving along promptly.\n\n\\* Prep the candidate for their board interview (if required).\n\nTLDR; A lot of work goes on behind the scenes that many tenants might not see.\n\nA couple of other things I'd like to note:\n\n\\* If you hire your own representative, you do not pay any more than the 15% fee. When I represent tenants, I split the 15% with the listing agent.\n\n\\* There are definitely bad agents out there and they give the rest of us a bad name. I'm sorry to anyone who felt they had to deal with a surly/unresponsive/mean broker.\n\n\\* The agent does not keep the 15%. Agents split the fee with the brokerage they work for.

Most large brokerages start their agents off at less than a 50/50 split.\n\nPersonally, I was a software engineer at Google for almost a decade before I became an agent.

I sorta thought this was normal since I saw the same apartment in another websites listing.\n\nI shrugged it off and decided to apply for the second one after tirelessly asking the broker about the availability of the second one. That’s how I lost the second $100. Everything went to shit when the guy stopped returning my messages or emails. Left a review to his page on google reviews after that. During my scathing review, that’s when I found out the guy is a pretty scummy guy, he leaves everyone hanging apparently. Small brokerage company and this is a pretty normal move from them.

You’ll need a guarantor if you don’t earn enough. Most folks have roommates in their twenties.\n\n2/ 1 month security plus first months rent plus a month’s worth for broker fee is pretty common. You can try to avoid broker fees but it’s tricky. Definitely learn how to avoid common junk/illegal fees like key money; the city has a lot of good resources for renters. https://www.nyc.gov/site/hpd/services-and-information/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities.page\n\n3/ for the most part landlords only care that you’ve got stable employment and make enough to pay the rent. Again annual gross 40x monthly is a standard requirement; if you meet this you shouldn’t need a guarantor.\n\n4/ you get what you pay for. I strongly recommend living in a neighborhood you like in a lesser apartment and/or with roommates to make it more affordable, versus a better apartment where you don’t want to live. Nobody lives here because they love their apartment. We live here because we love our neighborhoods and city.\n\nPro tip- look up building history on the HPD website (https://www.nyc.gov/site/hpd/about/hpd-online.page) to see violations and complaint history. Every building has problems; what you want to see is that they’re addressed, and not recurring or consistent. Leaks happen. Mice happen. Heat issues happen. You don’t want roaches. You don’t want a place where they don’t resolve violations quickly.', 'Roommates?', ""You don't have to live in Manhattan. Look for areas in Queens or Brooklyn that are close to the train lines. Much cheaper compared to Manhattan"", ""1. It varies. You need to show you make 40x the monthly rent to get accepted for most apartments, but you could also pay less if you find a cheaper place. \n\n2. Brokers are parasites who unfortunately are allowed to take exorbitant fees from tenants for basically nothing (they work for the landlord). However, you can try to negotiate with them. I'd say 15% is standard, so really less than 3-4 months' rent. But I've gotten them down to 10% in a couple of instances.\n\n3.

If you desire to rent a $2000 apartment, you need to make 40x (I believe gross) - $80k. I have seen this pretty much universally - market rate apartments, Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens. This rule is not very different from the ""you must make 3x rent per month"" - it\'s effectively the same qualification that you would find in any other city in the US.\n\n2) Brokers/realtors/agents -- If you hire an agent for full service search on your behalf, you should expect to pay. The fee is typically 15% annual rent. If you do the search yourself, whoever is listing the apartment on behalf of a building or landlord WILL also try to charge you the same fee. This is different from what you might experience in other cities. Trying pay less in broker/agent\'s fee is doable, for example: StreetEasy has a ""no fee"" filter. Good luck  \n  \n3) In my experience, you can provide your current/latest paystubs AND a proof of employment letter. Your future employer states that you will be employed at specific salary. That serves as a good way to prove that you will have the income necessary to afford the rent.  \n  \n4) Wild... A lot of people live with roommates. So if you can live with roommates, you can save a decent chunk.

You are welcome to find a cheaper apartment—I know people who make 100k but pay less than 2.5k—but most landlords will not rent to you unless you make a firm 40x. If you have more money, you're probably willing to spend more money for either a bigger apartment or a bigger area, but nobody's gonna give you grief for living *below* your means. Figure out what you, personally, can realistically afford, do not exceed that.\n\n2. Yes, 99% of brokers are absolute ticks on the system and unless you limit your search to no-fee places, you can generally expect to pay 15% of the annual price as a fee...sometimes more, sometimes less. No-fee listings do exist but they're competitive for obvious reasons. Yes, we all know it sucks, it has gotten worse in recent years.\n\n3. They'll want to see your tax returns regardless but you can also include an offer letter from your new workplace stating your new income and that number should suffice as 40x proof.\n\n4. Roommates, live farther out in a borough, don't get starry-eyed about living in the most expensive/luxury building or area that you can afford, be smart about where you shop for groceries/clothes/etc. Honestly I'd probably not save money living elsewhere because here I don't have any car expenses—I'd be able to have more *space* in another part of the country, but it wouldn't actually save me any *money*.

Brokers deal with all the applicants and show the place because there’s a lot of ppl trying to get an apartment. Up front fees consist of 1st Months rent, Deposit which is equal to 1 months rent, broker fee sometimes equal to 1 months rent.

You need to make 40x the monthly rent to qualify but that doesn’t mean you HAVE to pay that much. You can pay less than that if you find a cheaper place have roommates or otherwise get lucky. Most of the units I saw the 40x was base salary only not including annual bonus but some did include that, so don’t be afraid to ask and clarify on that. \n\n2. My broker fee was 12% of the annual rent. So just under $4K for me (the rent for my place is $2,695). Where I come from broker fees aren’t a thing so that was definitely a sticker shock. There are apartments that don’t have a broker fee but there’s less of them. I found my place on StreetEasy; basically you reach out and you set up a time with the broker to see the place and usually you give them your application materials. \n\n3. I showed them my offer letter that showed I was making more money than at my current job. So that, plus my prior 2 years of tax returns W2s etc. was fine.

Not every landlord may do this but mine did so just be prepared.', ""1. People who make 100k often have roomates and I'd recommend it if I was under 30. People live like college students for longer. Generally living alone or with one roomate is a big premium in new york. It's fairly easy to find a room for 1000 to 1500. If your willing to pay a bit more, 3 roommates with a 2k budget (6k total) will get a lot nicer place than someone can get for 3k on their own.\n\n2. 40x is upper limit for that you qualify for. People who make 400k don't necessarily rent 10k apartments, most of them are renting 3 to 5k places.\n\n3. Brokers are real estate agent. NYC most buildings do not have leasing offices. They essentially handle filtering applications for land lords. Currently in NYC brokers are either paid by tenants or land lords, and when land lord pays its a no fee apartment. Typically nicer apartments at lower price points have fees, luxury units are less likely to have fees. Think about land lords incentives. If they know they have a place that they can rent tomorrow, why would they pay the brokers fee and not have the tenant do it instead?\n\n4. Typical broker fee is one to two months, generally there is a deposit of one month and you hage first months rent. Generally expect to need 2 to 4 months worth  of rent on hand to move in on your own somewhere. \n\n5. May through August seems to be hell for renting.\n\n6.

The only additional thing I'd suggest is to find a short term (3-6 mo) furnished room sublet if you can, and then apartment  hunt from there. It'll give you a chance to get to know the neighborhoods in the city, how much commute time you can tolerate (further from Manhattan is cheaper), and it'll give you a chance to look around and know what you're looking at. This is a terrible time to apartment hunt for an affordable apartment because all the students are looking as well for next fall, but rents will go down slightly after school starts. I don't know what your target rent is, but the more roommates you have, the cheaper it will be. I'm a performer with side jobs, and in my mid-20's so my budget is tiny. I make just under $50K a year at this point. I live in Queens and pay about $1100 for my room in a four bedroom, plus 1/4 of the gas and electric bill. Because I came out here without a job in place, I used a parent guarantor, who had to show 100x the rent. The good news is that I only had to pay one month's rent as a down payment, no final month's rent, and no brokers fee because I went through an advertisement by the leasing agency vs. a broker. You can find those deals if you have time to look vs being under pressure to find something immediately. As far as roommates go, lots of people in NYC move in with strangers.

To be a REALTOR you have to be a member of the Realtor association which almost nobody in most of NYC is. It is a bit more common outer parts of Queens and Staten Island, and maybe a bit of Brooklyn.\n\nIn NYS there are three types of licenses.\n\nBroker\n\nAssociate Broker\n\nLicensed Real Estate Salesperson. (commonly called agent)\n\nIf you are an AB or an LRES you have to have a Broker hold your license, and money and listings have to flow through them. You are basically working jointly with your broker and almost always they are getting a share of your commission or you are paying them a fee for service.\n\nAny of these titles can represent a landlord, any of them can represent a tenant.\n\nIf you want your own agent you can have that person set up showings, represent you, and negotiate for you. If it's an apartment with a traditional fee, they would split the money with the listing agent. In other scenarios a landlord might pay them or you might pay only them.\n\nThat all works the same way whether they are a Broker, Associate Broker or LRES (agent.)\n\nA Broker does need to be more experienced, and take a longer exam, but really plenty of LRES agents know what they are doing and unless they want to move towards owning a business there is not really a need to get the higher title.\n\nHope that helps!\n\nSuzanne"", 'There are a lot of  1 or 2 bedroom basement apartments in Jamaica NY for under 1.5K.', '1/ Yeah and you should pay even less than that.

You can try negotiating but apartments are in high demand in nyc so it may or may not work. Hopefully legislation may change this absurdity soon. \n\n3/ depends on the landlord.

Streeteasy has a filter for “no fee” apartments, wherein the LL foots the bill for the broker. It usually costs 1 month or 15% of 1 year.

Usually people your age honestly because they value being near nightlife more than other things. From my experience eventually people just want a nicer apartment and they move into queens/brooklyn and pay less. No one should pay 10k for an apartment unless it includes a pool. I make almost 200x my rent. But a lot of people don’t make enough money to be in that position. I like in a reasonably cheap apartment that is still nice. It’s 40x is still well above median income. \n\n2. Yeah it’s a lot to move in. I’m pretty sure brokers fees are capped now. But it’s still a lot of money. I was around 4.5x monthly rent on my last move for costs with all the fees and movers and cleaners and what not. \n\n3. Usually if you have a broker you tell them this. Then they negotiate that issue for you. I usually send pay stubs. But you might need an offer letter if it’s very new. \n\n4. Yes and no. It depends on your lifestyle. I made under 20k the first 8 years I lived here. Which the internet says is 27k today. I had a lot of roommates and I ate a lot of $1 pizza. My ex 5 years ago made 35k by choice (he had a well paying job he just did it very part time). That was the exact amount he needed to live. Currently for my lifestyle I need around 200k, but if I lost my job I could make 150k work. I recommend not living at the extent of your salary so you have an emergency fund and what not. \n\n5. Depends on the apartment. Things stabilized at low rents tend to not be very nice. If they were renovated to be nice they would have gone up in price. Some apartments are actually stabilized at high numbers like more than the rent they charge. Some of those are quite nice, but also they can raise your rent all the way to the stabilized number so it’s important not just to know it’s stabilized but what number it’s stabilized at. Stabilized apartments are tough to find and have significantly more competition. They also aren’t as cheap as the media would have you believe. Someone in a $500 stabilized apartment has been there for 20 years. I just checked street easy and most of them cost around what my current apartment costs.

Yes. That’s for everyone in the household. Most get roommates or partner if they make $100k or less. You can also elect to have a longer commute into Manhattan (ex: Jersey City) in exchange for cheaper rent. \n\n2. Broker fees suck. As a rule of thumb, you should have ~$10k for a move to cover first/last month rent and security deposit. Then some for the broker. Some moving company fees. It adds up. If the company wants you bad enough, they may cough up relocation fees. \n\n3. Get a letter from the employer with prospective income. I’ve seen landlords be lenient with this as long as your bank statements show that you have enough to cover if you lost your job. \n\n4. Roommates. Living with family if you’re a native NYer. \n\nThings to watch out for:\n* Assuming you won’t be bringing your car: Make sure you have more than one way to get to work, whether it’s more than one train stop or one train stop and a bus that can take you to another train. \n* The cost of living here is expensive. Don’t forget to calculate the increased cost of food, laundromats, etc.\n* Don’t fall for the “free month of rent” unless you plan on moving in a year. Your rent will increase by that much next year. \n* I can’t stress this enough but sooo many people here job hop because hiring happens just as frequently as layoffs do.

These are where generally you’ll find the highest number of more affordable apartments/rooms.\n\nIn my opinion though, don’t limit yourself to certain areas. The tools and methods you use to find an apartment are, in my opinion, far more important than searching for housing in any one given neighborhood. There are cheap places to rent in every borough. You just have to know how to find them and you have to get a little bit lucky. \n\nHere’s one approach I’d recommend:\n\n1.) Download a bunch of housing apps to your phone. Streeteasy, hot pads, spareroom, zillow rentals, craigslist, facebook, and apartment list are a good start. Even this subreddit gets great listings sometimes. Some of these apps are better than others thougj. Over time you can delete the ones that are not as useful to your search. A good goal is to figure out what rooms/apartments in various areas are going for. At this stage you’re doing market research and these are tools that can help you do that so you can figure out where to prioritize your time searching.\n\n2.) The most risky sites can have the best deals. Craigslist is the best example. Its full of listings made by people who are trying to scam you. It’s also full of legitimate listings by tenants and landlords trying to rent a room in their apartment. The way you can decipher between the two is just by reading a bunch of listings and gauging what sounds like it’s coming from a legitimate person versus a scammer. Scammers are on every website though, and some scammers are more sophisticated than others. So keep your guard up and trust your instincts. Don’t rent a place without seeing it first.\n\n3.) Use filters. You’ll be a lot more successful on all these sites if you use filters. Put your maximum budget but also put a minimum if you can, so you filter out a lot of the junk that’s priced too good to be true. Also sort by recent listings and specify a zip code or neighborhood if you have one in mind. For your situation, if you’re using Craigslist for example, I would suggest putting your minimum budget as $600 and your max at say $1100. Whatever seems right for your situation. This way you can focus your limited energy on listings that are more likely to be legit.\n\n4.) Reach out and visit apartments. If you want to eventually rent a place, you have to get used to visiting apartments, asking good questions to landlords, tenants, real estate companies, etc., and determining if you can see yourself living in a certain apartment. Start a note on your phone somewhere and start writing questions you’ll want to ask to those who show you a place.\n\n5.) Get your documents ready. Have everything in a folder on your computer (ideally in a cloud based application). Copies of your ID, bank statements, tax returns, credit report, W2s, savings accounts, etc. Different people will ask for different documents. Rooms move quick and you want to give yourself every advantage you can get.\n\n6.) Research places regularly. It depends on the urgency you have with wanting to move. At the peak of my most recent apartment search I was looking at multiple sites/apps multiple times per day each.\n\n7.) Do research before signing a lease. There are sites available to verify if an address is legit, if the apartment or unit has any previous issues, if the landlord is overbearing, etc. The more knowledge you have the better you’ll set yourself up for finding a place you love.\n\nThis isn’t an exhaustive list.

This way, you can have 1st months rent and a security deposit. Also, build credit if you don't have any. So let's say $5000 cash saved, that will take 3 months if you're aggressively saving and working full time and over time. \n\nCut out unnecessary expenses, and apply for a Discover credit card. If you don't get approved, apply for the secured card. Also, download Kickoff, Self, and similar apps. Do your research. Credit builders don't make you magically responsible. \n\nPut small bills like a Netflix subscription or your phone bill on your cards. This way, you have multiple lines of credit. Some apps may give you a loan. Just pay it back on time, and your credit score will be 700+. This is the cheat code to life as you can now finance anything. \n\nIf you are being abused at home, whether it's physically or verbally, then you have options. You can either go get a studio or a 1 bed room. These are very expensive in New York and it can be done at your salary, but most people just live in bigger apartments with roommates.\n\nYou can go to a homeless shelter and get services. Trust me, there are really good shelters and really shitty ones. Depending on how old you are, you will get treated better if you're younger, specifically 18 - 23. For parents, PATH is best. If you're a single male or a couple, AFIC is your best bet. Only domestic partnership and marriage can prove you're a couple.\n\nYou also get treated better if you have a spouse, domestic partner, or child.\n\nI also recommend that you do this in conjunction with switching careers. I personally would get into tech because of the massive opportunities. Even non technical roles are better paid. There are also paid internships and apprenticeships. I suggest a free boot camp. For young people, that's Marcy Lab School. For everyone else, Per Scholas. I'm African American, so I recommend Tech is the New Black YouTube channel and boot camp.

I had drove over two days in a small U-Haul and was just ready to get unpacked. We get there and none of the codes work on the 10 lockboxes outside. So then I had to call management which turned into a disaster in itself. Finally a guy shows up almost an hour later while I have a U-Haul on a small 1 way street. \n\nThen the door lock is dead when he finally gets us in the front door. And of course this isn’t a door lock that takes a key or an external battery. So now he spends the next two hours breaking into our apartment. \n\nWhen he finally gets the door open (1:30) the apartment is full of furniture, coffee maker, cups, plates, you name it. It’s furnished, which was not on my lease. So now we have no where to put our stuff. \n\nThe U-Haul at this time has already received two tickets and we have no where to move into. We slammed all of their stuff into the bedroom, and put all of our stuff literally to the ceiling in the living room. Now we can’t unpack until they get their stuff and we can barely even move in this apartment. \n\nI’m not exaggerating.. I spent almost a month trying to get them to pick up their stuff. They got the furniture after two weeks but there were still all kinds of other stuff. After day after day of no response I just set the stuff out in the curb. June Homes never even cared to follow up. \n\nNext comes the double utility bills. Double electricity, double heat, double gas, it was always messed up month after month. They only let you use utilities through their app and it’s a mess in itself. I got charged for months of utilities even after my lease ended and had to fight every month that I don’t owe this bill. \n\nNext comes the water leak. This situation is likely on my super/landlord but it was made way worse by June Homes incompetence. Their customer service is the worst/ doesn’t follow up/ gets passed on to the next person who has no idea what’s going on. Long story short there was a pipe burst up stairs in the unit down the hall right around Christmas. We woke up to airbnb guests in the hall yelling and water just gushing. Well guess what, that water ran through the ceiling and created a leak, a water bubble, and an electrical box filled with water that was still active (I got shocked when assessing how bad the problem was). The actual leak and water bubble was over the apartment breaker box. \nI sent countless photos, requests, videos, phone calls, and it never got fixed. We lived with that leak from Christmas until August. \n\nThere’s more issues, and this isn’t even the worst. Stay AWAY from June homes.', ""Cannot express enough how much I loathe June Homes.

There are 10s of 1000s of rental apartments in the city and in general they don\'t even need to be ""listed"" You would be in essence advertising for your LL for free, you\'re not getting anything out of it and an incoming potential tenant is going to be subject to the same process to apply for and get the apartment regardless of where they saw the initial post. There\'s no leg up or getting to the front of the line. Unless the LL is a DIY mom and pop shop, they would be represented and no matter where an inquiry comes from, it still has to go through their broker. I appreciate and applaud your trying to buck the system, but the reality is what you\'re doing is the exact thing that every LL\'s real estate agent/broker or management co is already doing. For real, what are you getting out of it and who is this.supposed.to help? To be clear, if your LL has a management co or broker that reps.them, and their apartments are not an open Listings, it wouldn\'t even be legal for you or anyone else  to post the apartment anywhere without your LL\'s permission.

It was bad.  \n\nDon’t quote me on the numbers, but the landlord said it would take around 40k-50k to do a full gut reno and get the apartment back to code. After investing that into the unit, the 2019 RS law would only allow the rent to be raised to maybe $1.1k.  \n\nThe tenant vacated that apartment in early 2020. It’s still sitting empty today. \n\nI had been in nyc real estate for ~10 years at the time and had seen RS leases were landlords justify a rent increase on a RS apartment - new boiler, updates to the elevator, new electric etc…+ how long the apartment had been empty. \n\nAll those calculations that got them a decent return on their investment was out the window in 2019 and some landlords feel they wouldn’t see their investment back when renovating. Some landlords continue to illegally deregulate apartments (definitely a thing before 2019) as well. \n\nOne could argue that the landlord should have kept the apartment up to code over the duration of the tenant’s actual lease and this problem wouldn’t exist, and I’d agree. \n\nRegarding taxes/fines, look at some of the landlords sued by the state for housing discrimination (not accepting vouchers) and having to pay 50k-200k+ per infraction. And those same landlords are still doing it today. They don’t care. I think Goldfarb (who has around 6000 units) has been sued and fined at least 3 times since 2014. A case from 2018 settled last year for a total fine of just under $1,000,000 (https://fairhousingjustice.org/enforcement/fhjc-wins-federal-trial-against-goldfarb-properties/#:~:text=The%20Court%20also%20ordered%20Goldfarb,with%20rental%20subsidies%20or%20vouchers) \n\nFines are a minor inconvenience of doing business. The same way that a landlords calculates a building’s vacancy rate when looking at its cap rate. \n\nIf the state levied a tax/fine of some sort, I’m sure the landlords would simply do a calculation on how many RS apartments they have sitting empty, how much it would cost to renovate all of them, when they’d expect their investment back, the increase in utilities (water, oil, trash removal) they’d be paying for the occupied apartments versus the amount of fine/tax and I’m sure there’s a good few that would pay the fine and move on as if nothing happened. \n\nThe only solution to any of this is for the city to build more housing.

Extend the rent controlled rental increase policies to ALL units.  That will help make all increases less volatile.  A lot of the perceived loss of rent comes from the fact that so many market rate units are being set at unreasonable prices creating large amounts of turn over.  Nullifying the law making it illegal to require a renter to pay a broker’s fee was stupid.  The current system incentivizes turn over.  \n\nIt’s not normal or healthy for a person to need to move once a year because they received a 20% rental increase on a market rate apartment because they couldn’t (1) didn’t qualify for an income capped unit (2) couldn’t locate a rent stabilized or controlled unit or (3) found a rent stabilized or controls unit but couldn’t afford the unreasonable brokers fee.', 'I have lived in a stabilized building for 25 years and the owners are using every loop hole in the system to take units out of stabilization.\n\nFor example, combining two units into one, and making deals with temporary tenants to charge them a discounted rate if they allow them to change the paperwork with the city.', ""There aren't so many of them that it's a real problem.

It’s your fault you bought property and didn’t bring it up to code over time.', 'I think it would be interesting to make it more the norm to have the tenant update a stabilized unit every year they live in it so that it is up to code/currant standard of habitability. In many apartments in Germany people are expected to buy most of a/a whole kitchen for their apartment. If you moved into a stabilized unit and knew up front you were expected to buy XYZ and make sure everything was kept up dated so it didn’t fall into disrepair would you still go for it in exchange for lower rent? \n\nOne of the reasons so many stabilized places are off market is because they’re uninhabitable because the previous tenants lived there for so long. It wasn’t worth it to those tenants to update because of the rules that renovation = landlord allowed to raise the rent. The problem is now that those people are gone it’s not worth it for the landlord to do any updates when they know they won’t get their money back for that for a very long time. If a landlord said I could move into a stabilized place for the current stabilized price in exchange for paying for the renovation and keeping the place up to code I’d go for it if I thought I was staying in NYC for a long time. \n\nI have no clue the logistics of making any of that work, if it even could, but I think it would be a decent compromise. Tenant gets a stabilized unit that’s less expensive than average units and doesn’t have to worry about rent going up like crazy, landlord won’t have to worry about paying to update and will just be making money off the new tenant. I’m sure I’ll see the argument that it’s not worth it for a tenant to do since they don’t own the place and are only adding value for the landlord, but as someone who has no plans to ever leave Manhattan and can’t see ever affording to own property it would be worth it to me!', ""If they hold apartment stock this means other landlords are getting rent sooner.

They have wealthy parents. \n\nEven with my partner and I making sufficient money, the landlord STILL required us to have a guarantor simply because our credit wasn’t perfect and we are younger. I’d also add that this is why some people pay so much money to rent a bedroom even if they could find a cheap apartment nearby (I know some people that pay $2400 a month for a bedroom in Chelsea but could find a studio for only a hundred or two more in a nearby neighborhood, but simply couldn’t make it through the approval process).', 'economic nepotism', 'my roommate and i are 22 both making 6 figures and we barely got approved places. we end up picking between 2 and had a great broker. roommates. patience, and research got us through', 'Have you tried applying to Mitchell Lama apartments that have no waitlist?

Maybe owners are starting to adjust prices based on the increased inquiries."", 'I just finished hunting for an apartment after about a month and here is everything I’ve gathered is happening from this experience:\n\n1. When the price is low, they want as many people to show up as possible to create a frenzied bidding war, negotiating on offering more per month in rent as well as promising brokers a full 15% fee. The broker then pits bids (renters like us) against each other and lets management decide.\n2. Brokers 100% represent the landlord and despite any promise to advocate for you, they’ll ultimately turn their attention to the highest bidder\n3. When they list the rental price high, landlords and brokers are trying to attract higher income folks to open houses and applications and avoid what they feel are less qualified/desirable applicants.\n4. Landlords aren’t the ones setting the prices — blame brokers. A broker whispers into a landlord’s ear and says, “3000 for this unit? You could easily get more. Watch this,” and then the broker will start a bidding war. I viewed a one bedroom apartment priced at 3200/mo and it eventually got up to 3600.\n5. Rental price inflation is driven by desperation. Not actual value. \n\nThe sad truth of it is that the rental market runs on “money talks” philosophy. Not to mention you are also up against any prejudices brokers/landlords/management companies have against a particular renter that could get them thrown out as “unqualified.”\n\nWhat really pissed me off about this process is that I pushed back on a broker who was trying to get me to increase my bid. I told him that comparable units in the area were waaaaaay cheaper and more spacious and his response was, “Well it’s a free market rental so ultimately, if someone is willing to pay, that’s what the unit is worth.” I didn’t need a basic econ lesson to know that this was a bullshit excuse and I walked away from the process\n\nThe problem is that these brokers and landlords are using scarcity and our desperation as levers to pull. The prices we’re seeing are reflective of how desperate the previous tenant was to get their apartment search over with. And it’s all perfectly legal.', ""On average not really. NYC has a construction problem. There simply isn't enough supply to keep on demand. This has been gone on for years.  Sure there are brokers who try to play the market, but on average things are priced correctly.Street Easy also has a lot of Metadata, if you play with their market data (you can pull things like median rent by neighorhood/bedroom) and get a good idea of the correct price is for the median apartment market (which in most neighborhoods is a non-luxury unit).\n\nIn general, I've had a lot of luck finding relatively good apartments for hte money and have helped friends do so. I am not talking about unicorn deals, but generally finding places that probably could charge 10 to 20 percent more and expect to rent the apartment. Like my unit for example is a well maintained walkup with in unit laundry, dishwasher and ample kitchen space in prime LES next to the subway. It costs 2700$ a month. Without the in unit laundry it would still probably rent 2700$. Its also not nice enough that it could rent for 3000$ in the winter market, because it is a small walk-up.Similarly, I helped a friend find a large studio in UES in an elevator/laundry in building in prime UES (near both express subways in the liveliest area) for under 2500. This unit probably could have asked 2800$ and still expected to rent.\n\nAlso your coming out of the winter market now, so you can expect prices to start going up. I've wasted far too much time looking at street easy and have to come to understand that if an apartment is sitting more than two weeks, its usually because something is wrong with it, the place isn't ready to rent yet, or the broker just forgot to take down the listing.\n\nIn the case of the unit your looking at, what explains the listing being up for so long.\n\n1. Its a CO-OP. The tenant would have to be approved by the board which takes a while.\n2. It really seems over priced for what it is, especially in the October through January winter market. Like at 4k, I would expect laundry in unit (in building at a minimum), a dish washer,   and possibly a door man.

See RAND's study here : [https://www.rand.org/pubs/research\\_reports/RRA2775-1.html](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA2775-1.html)\n\nThe fact that there are price controls essentially means everyone who is not under price controls generally pays more, because your subsidizing those below market rate units. Especially since in New York unless its a new construction building with some sort of tax break, your highly likely in an old apartment that has a mix of rent stabilized units and units that were destabilized when the laws were more lax and that results that the people who are destabilized have to pay even higher prices. This is especially the case because if the apartment was rent stabilized a long time ago,  the price is so low that often the cost of maintaining the unit is more than what the paying (for example there are some rent stabilized tenants in my building paying 600$ a month).  \n  \n Rent stabilization  that is not via tax abatement is essentially extremely tenant friendly. It basically makes it near impossible to kick you out, your lease has to be renewed as long as your paying rent and not doing anything illegal. You can pass down the apartment lease along oyur family line. Think aobut that from an owner's p.o.v.  The guy that your renting to basically has the right to the unit forever as long as they pay rent and don't break the law. You can't raise prices faster than inflation even if the market price in your area significantly higher or if the cost of maintenance goes up much faster than inflation etc. Its basically like you don't even really own the place. So that is tenant friendly.\n\nWhile the policies are good for people who are in stabilized housing they generally contribute to housing shortages and deter construction of new housing.

You can hopefully understand how it\'s really hard for an ordinary working person to pay subsidize someone else\'s living expenses for 20 months. \n\nWhat most people don\'t know is that housing court cases are not overseen by actual judges but by attorneys appointed by some committee.

Even if that specific building isn't to your liking, the management company likely manages other buildings and has the knowledge of whose lease is expiring when. As with everything in NYC, you get better deals through old school avenues like cold calling, and door knocking than you ever will through an app or website. Same works for food delivery.

There are a ton of really great options though and there are pros and cons to almost all of them, some of which you won’t realize unless you move into that neighborhood. \n\nHonestly, I’ve never really felt “unsafe” in most of Manhattan…particularly in the areas that tend to have apartments in that price range. This isn’t 80s-90s lower Manhattan. I routinely walk around with like 10-15k worth of camera gear and headphones on and never had an issue. Not to dismiss that part.

Don’t even have to go outside.) It’s a totally feasible walk as well, except maybe for northern W Village. But as you’ll be reasonably close to multiple lines, you’ll rarely run into issues for both. \n\nFor recreation, you’ve got tons of cafes, shops, and restaurants, literally the best in the city. Hudson River Park is a great outdoor space, and dog friendly (I see people walking all the time, plus’s several dog parks.) Wash Sq Park is also pretty good, and Central Park is only a short subway ride away if you need a change of pace. And usually most of your needs are pretty nearby, there are enough grocery stores, bodegas, etc scattered around. \n\nThese neighborhoods are pricey, but if your 5-7k budget is just for rent, you’ve should be more than fine, you can probably get a really nice 1bed without much problem. If that’s your total living expenses and your amt allotted to rent is lower, you can still do pretty well with studios or older apts.', 'Chinatown- Two Bridges-hear me out- there are rentals there for much less than your budget, a couple good buildings with elevators.

Still close to the 4/5/6 if needed. \n\nYou’d have your pick of great places up here with that budget! The Q is so reliable and can get you almost anywhere in Manhattan so fast. From the Q 86th street platform to Cortlandt St (one of the stops that can bring you to the WTC campus) is less than 20 min. You just transfer across the platform at 14th Street to the R/W train and  go 5 stops. Once you get there, you can stay underground into the Oculus and get into most WTC buildings that way! Super nice in the winter. \n\nI would avoid moving to FiDi bc it’s closed up on the weekends. Even Duane Reades. \n\n(34F, lived in Brooklyn for 4 years and UES for 4 years. This is the best neighborhood I’ve ever lived in!) \n\nGood luck! 🍀', 'Westchester, Hoboken.', '[removed]']"
