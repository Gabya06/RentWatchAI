\\u201cyeah i don\\u2019t think you could either\\u201d i get it, you don't have the mental fortitude :) new york is devastated by you not being there it takes a certain kind of person to live here. sometimes i wonder whether i am cut out for it. but it is the city that puts all others to shame. i can walk out my door and never hop in a car or even a train and do all of my grocery shopping, go to the gym, sit and read by the waterfront or in a nearby park, decide on dinner at 20 restaurants 300 feet away, and watch the lights flicker on just as the sun sets. i can hear 5 different languages just walking to get breakfast. i have my choice of 10 different coffee shops to do wfh. i can thrift free art and furniture right off the street. maybe there\\u2019s a city or two in europe that could, perhaps, match some of the vibes i get here. but if i were a betting man, my money would always be on the sui generis of cities. \\u201ci know, i can tell\\u201d and look at them smugly. it\\u2019s interesting that this is such a common comment - i would never think to turn to someone who lives in kansas and declare that i could never live how they live. it would be so condescending for me to say that as a new yorker, but somehow the reverse is not\\u2026? maybe because it\\u2019s \\u201cpunching up\\u201d aka the city is so obviously desirable there\\u2019s a reason so many of the world\\u2019s most popular shows and movies take place here and it\\u2019s packed to the gills with people trying to make it here. for this reason i usually shrug it off as little sister behavior. ![gif](giphy|j8fzim9vobu6q) yeah it\\u2019s not for the weak the city weeds out the bitches. \\u201ci could never live in *insert town or suburb where they live*. i don\\u2019t know how people can live there.\\u201d \\u201cnot surprised\\u201d okay would you like to list anything else you don\\u2019t do? should i start listing the things i don\\u2019t do? sorry i\\u2019m not so good with weird conversations. my cousin who lives in a trailer in bumfuck, backwoods usa said he could never live here and i just laughed and replied \\u201coh i agree, this city isn\\u2019t for the weak.\\u201d some people aren\\u2019t built to handle how tough it is either \\u201cyeah, i don\\u2019t think you could either\\u201d or \\u201ci couldn\\u2019t live where you live either\\u201d \\ud83d\\ude02 \\u201c8.3 million people live here so its actually not that hard?\\u201d don\\u2019t. a friend and his wife were flabbergasted when i told them that after a weekend of complaining how much they would never live in nyc while crashing at my place. not with that attitude! yeah you probably couldn\\u2019t. \\\"who says we want you here?\\\" this is a classic republican/trump attitude, so i view it as very political. \\\"i'm sorry your mental weakness is drowning out your statement, please rephrase \\\" \\ud83e\\udd37\\ud83c\\udffb\\u200d\\u2642\\ufe0f you\\u2019re right, you couldn\\u2019t. \\u201cis that not a rude thing to say where you\\u2019re from?\\u201d good thing nobody\\u2019s inviting you. only the strongest survives new york. i'd say, you don't know what you're talking about. fuck you!\\u00a0 or \\\"to each, his own\\\" i say \\u201cgood\\u201d we don\\u2019t want you here. you weren\\u2019t invited then don\\u2019t there\\u2019s only one answer. \\u201cfuggisyoutalmbout?\\u201d you either love it or hate it! it\\u2019s great that you don\\u2019t then :) i tell them nyc has 8 million people so maybe you should stfu and learn something ![gif](giphy|j8fzim9vobu6q) then dont shut up  go sit over there  please go away \\u201cyeah you definitely couldn\\u2019t!\\u201d my mom always says this. great, you\\u2019ve chosen where you want to live and i\\u2019ve chosen where i ant to live. i don\\u2019t spend all my time telling you how much i hate where you live why do you do it to me lol i say. fuck you. you want to but you can\\u2019t it\\u2019s usually some fools stuck in an echo chamber of disinformation showing random photos of fire, broken windows, and wrecked police cars from 2020. but yeah, no place like ny. i travel quite a bit, have had to move all over for work, and i always miss ny in the end. don\\u2019t let the door hit you in the ass! adios!!! you have to be tough to live in new york a friend of mine lived in new york city had a dog named taxi. \\u201cyeah, it\\u2019s not for everybody.\\u201d tell them they probably wouldn\\u2019t be happy here and they should stay where they are. i moved to brooklyn in 2006-straight from college and been here since. could not imagine living anywhere else!!! go fuck yourself! we aren't exactly \\\"living\\\" ![gif](giphy|1msy0o1ma3bslybzua|downsized) ![gif](giphy|ldbuyzawu8l4i|downsized)  \\\"then, don't\\\" the people who say this would so obviously get eaten alive that i\\u2019m not bothered anymore. they can keep thinking that when you live in nyc there\\u2019s someone lurking around every corner to stab you and no one speaks english or whatever fb told them. at least i make more than $7/hour and i have the option to fuck someone who isn\\u2019t my second cousin. that's fine. say don\\u2019t. you have no idea what you\\u2019re missing. i lived here my whole life. and love it \\\"you can't handle it, it's okay.\\\" i agree. [deleted] \\\"i'm here, in one piece and as financially ranked as the rest of us.\\\" same probably you get used to it.  (i'm a transplant) \\ud83d\\udc4d\\ud83c\\udffd \\u201cya know, that reminds me of an old yogi berra saying\\u201d \\\"me neither, can i leave?\\\" good i know ok then. it's not for everyone and honestly a lot of people complain about creature comforts. i always thought of it as look at the city as your extended living room and you've got every opportunity open to you.  it's not some peoples cup of tea and that's perfectly ok.   i mean, i could never live in new jersey. \\ud83d\\ude43 https://preview.redd.it/ay8qe0graiid1.jpeg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=922157c92e472d2f8b90ce9ad6e3c64a1d5380aa  i be like cool i'll enjoy this view regardless. good the rents too damn high already \\ud83e\\udd37\\ud83c\\udffb\\u200d\\u2640\\ufe0f \\u201ci hate driving.\\u201d \\\"lol same. i like the quality of life though. could never live where you do\\\" nyc has the highest high and lowest lows. i love what makes it great way more than disdain what makes it challenging. \\u201cyeah i completely get you, a lot of people i know can\\u2019t afford it too\\u201d cool. i can\\u2019t live in gaithersburg either.  (actual convo with a friend of mine from maryland) i don't know how i live here either. slow blink and stare. my response is basically what others have commented, \\\"ok\\\". but i sometimes think i should have answered, \\\"why does someone living in new york make you feel the need to defend not living in new york?\\\" great, don't. it\\u2019s not for the weak \\u201cfacts. idk how i live here\\u201d \\u201cthat\\u2019s because your a lil bitch\\u201d we're full anyways \\ud83e\\udd23 well...i don't know how anyone can live here. note: where ever they live. go kick rocks! but also ok good! we don\\u2019t want no more transplants lol i mean i\\u2019ve lived here for 10 years and own a house in brooklyn and i still kind of feel like i can\\u2019t live here the first thing to remember when someone says this is it has nothing to do with you. they are just stating their preference (even if not worded well). so just don't take it personally.  everyone has preferences. usually i say something like \\\"i hear you\\\" which validates / witnesses their point of view without giving up mine. aaaaaannnnnnndddddd? i\\u2019ve always believed myself a better human for having lived there. ight ok boomer it is helpful to know why they say that. if it\\u2019s money, it\\u2019s rhetorical. but sometimes it\\u2019s bc it seems overwhelming, too big, too anonymous\\u2014to which i say, but each neighborhood is a small enclave. you get to know your local small grocer on the corner, your mail person, etc. and then when you walk further out, there\\u2019s the vital energy. you start to know which streets to walk, for when you want low-key energy and a direct passage. then another day, you want the variety and the hustle and bustle. i always feel seen in ny, and i equally *see* so many people. a main reason why i love it. give me your wallet! yeah rats are an acquired taste \\u201ci could visit the m&m store but i couldn\\u2019t live in the m&m store\\u201d cool lol but also same because it\\u2019s so unreal here lol when i'm feeling spicy: \\\"yeah, you gotta be tough and smart. not everyone can handle it. nothing wrong with that.\\\"   the last part being said in a tone of voice that insinuates there is, in fact, something wrong with that. *shrugs* \\u201cso don\\u2019t\\u201d get the f out in god speed there is a great new song by morgan st jean - \\u201cme this time.\\u201d  choosing nyc over a relationship.  i would play it for them mofo leave lol new york is always two decades ahead...imo \\u201cnyc is more than just time square and midtown.\\u201d \\\"i understand\\\" \\\"i agree\\\" the patrice o'neal head tilt/shoulder shrug but with the absolute minimum effort possible. of course you couldn't, dear (smiles sympathetically) i send them this video  https://youtu.be/tnpoplflt1w?si=gkripvvihmx4a0hr stay where you\\u2019re comfortable. i\\u2019m going to explore and discover myself. tell them to enjoy olive garden and everything closing at 8pm, we dont miss you it\\u2019s not for everyone i would never live in the suburbs of [atlanta / dallas / charlotte] k cool okay \\u201csame\\u201d there are more than a million people who disagree more for me ppl are always going to have something to say that could rub you the wrong way. it\\u2019s annoying but i\\u2019ve learned to just not engage. shrug your shoulders, nod, and move on to the next topic. \\u201cso anyway\\u2026\\u201d ppl aren\\u2019t going to change their opinions and you\\u2019re better off letting it go than letting it aggravate you.  don\\u2019t waste your time or energy! just my 2 cents! \\\"that's fair.\\\" because they probably have a point of two that is legitimate and probably not being confrontational perse. everyone has their preferences. why they decided to blurt that out loud depends on the situation i guess. why make care payments or car insurance payments or gasoline payments when everything is a block away folks in my hometown often say that but i think they mean it as a compliment, rather than an insult.   as i interpret it, they found the hustle and bustle of new york intimidating when they visited, so they are \\u201cin awe\\u201d (heavy air quotes there - i\\u2019m not so narcissistic i think they\\u2019re actually awed by me) of my ability to handle the grit, the trains, the noise, the directness, etc.   i tend to respond, \\u201coh i love it, it\\u2019s been a great fit for me.\\u201d keeps my pride intact without being dismissive. good. \\u201cyeop, only some people can take it.\\u201d being this poor must suck a lot of people won't admit what they don't know.\\u00a0 good for them for admitting it. good thing it\\u2019s me and not you \\u201cgood thing you don\\u2019t\\u201d \\u201ci don\\u2019t know how i could live here myself, still trying to figure that out\\u201d laughter i get it. this place kinda sucks. i mean i can totally see why someone wouldn\\u2019t want to live here. it\\u2019s not for everyone and as someone who\\u2019s lived here most of my life it does get frustrating sometimes. i moved from a quiet neighborhood in the midwest to new york and my response is \\u201ceh, ya get used to it after a bit\\u201d \\u201cyeah i get it. that\\u2019s how i feel about the suburbs\\u201d i tell them \\u201cthat\\u2019s great, bc i could never live where you live either.\\u201d and just look at their face, waiting for the irony to hit. \\u201cwell millions of people do so it must work somehow!\\u201d same! want to grab a coffee at park and 125th? i tell them i can't wait to get out too. then don\\u2019t - we have enough people already\\ud83d\\ude00 \\u201cprobably for the best. you\\u2019re not strong enough to handle it anyway\\u201d \\\"that was always allowed\\\" my husband agrees with them and says \\u201cyeah, you wouldn\\u2019t make it here.\\u201d \\u201cyeah, i totally hear you\\u201d  lifelong manhattanite going on 53, i get why people say that. it\\u2019s such a specific lifestyle. \\u201cyea, it\\u2019s not for everyone\\u201d that\\u2019s why the city is so empty! \\u201cnot everyone can live here\\u201d lmao \\u201cthe struggle is real.\\u201d this tickled me. just moved back to manhattan with my husband and four year old after a decade in the burbs. i don't know why everyone is so offended by this question. there's lots of places i wouldn't live either and would say the exact same thing about. that\\u2019s ok, it\\u2019s just not for you, don\\u2019t blame yourself. yeah, it\\u2019s not for everyone we don\\u2019t want you. nothing. i don\\u2019t care. \\u201cyeah, ny would probably eat you alive. it\\u2019s not for everyone.\\u201d \\u201ci don\\u2019t know how i live here either.\\u201d \\\"i dont blame you, it sucks\\\" the irony of wanting to live in nyc when i was broke vs being able to afford it now and not wanting to \\ud83d\\ude02 it\\u2019s funny how people say stuff like that not even knowing how nyc is or have never been there\\u2026. i agree i tell them - please go - makes more room for the people who truly want to be here. i tell them there is a waiting list for almost all apts. in ny and if there isn't then there is something wrong with the apt.   i tell people that the trick in life is to find a place where you like to live  - and then live there. \\u201cgood. new york is pretty full.\\u201d \\u201cit aint for everybody\\u201d + \\ud83e\\udd37\\ud83c\\udffd\\u200d\\u2640\\ufe0f then it\\u2019s a good thing you don\\u2019t! my response is i don\\u2019t blame you that\\u2019s a feature, not a bug there's a reason it's in every type of media to each their own. it\\u2019s def not for everyone. some people like space and peace and quiet. others want to live in the middle of all the action.  it\\u2019s a weird trend where everyone has to attack or defend where they live. if you like it there who gives af lol my wife and i moved back in february after 14 very pleasant years in the charleston suburbs. liked it well enough there, but always felt like this was home, could never really lean hard into life there. my standard response is \\\"it's not for everybody.\\\" there are plenty of things that suck about living here, i'm not totally sure this was the right call for us in our middle age years, but..like everywhere else would feel like i was on the outside looking in. literally 10-20 million people exist here just fine. most of the entire globe lives in places like nyc \\ud83e\\udd37\\ud83c\\udffe\\u200d\\u2640\\ufe0f then don\\u2019t i don\\u2019t know how i live here either well it depends where. i live eastern long island and it's expensive but so beautiful i wouldn't want to live anywhere else did i ask you? \\\"sir, this is a wendy's\\\" that\\u2019s right. you couldn\\u2019t. so many people scared of nyc for little reason. imo only drawback is cost of living. \\u201coh yeah, not everyone\\u2019s mentally strong enough to live in the city. good for you for knowing that about yourself.\\u201d non-condescending: \\u201ck\\u201d. condescending: \\u201cnot everyone can handle it\\u201d.  ultra-condescending: \\u201cactually, i really love it here. i\\u2019m so happy.\\u201d \\u201cthat\\u2019s how i feel about *insert their town*\\u201d i live in ny and as soon as i complete my latest project i am out of here and away from houckle. i agree with them. \\u201cokay lol i agree ig\\u201d native nyer here, i get it. nyc is like david lynch movies, i think they are beautiful, fascinating, and often disturbing masterpieces, but i totally get that some people just wouldn\\u2019t like them at all or find them appealing in any way. \\u201cwe built different\\u201d \\\"yeah only certain kind of people can live here. it has its own way of weeding out the weak\\\" \\u201csame, and i\\u2019ve lived there 24 years\\u201d well stay where you are then. don\\u2019t worry bout it sweetheart. you don't have to respond. let people live in their little world. i agree im not asking for a roomate, uncle mark \\u201ci didn\\u2019t ask\\u201d or \\u201cyeah, a lot of people can\\u2019t hack it!\\u201d mind ya business \\\"okay leave\\\" i know this place is a shit hole \\u201ci get that\\u201d \\u201cyou\\u2019re right, you definitely couldn\\u2019t handle it here\\u201d i say i understand. i only came here for the art as an artist but that whole crowd is snooty political and male dominated and disgusting so about to leave after 20 years. sick of the abuse and anger, commutes. i feel like the art meca will not be here. a more annoying question is, how do you live there, homeless, dangerous, and so small good literally nothing because i don\\u2019t care. just smile. i will tell him straight to his face - \\u201cyou.. you.. you are totally right and the city became garbage\\u201d don\\u2019t come \\\"yeah, i can tell.\\\" whenever tourists at my job say this i just respond with \\u201cwow. devastating.\\u201d provincial snowflakes, they scared of chocolate colored people good! it's too crowded as it is. good to know your limits i grew up in la and have lived in new york for almost 20 years. i fairly often have a dodgers or lakers hat on and new yorkers fairly often tell me how much they hate la.   i\\u2019ve found that responding with \\u201cif i wanted your opinion i would have asked you\\u201d works pretty well.   same thing works here. you don\\u2019t have to make it about where they live, you just have to remind them that just because they have an opinion doesn\\u2019t mean they need to share it. \\\"cause i work here\\\" is usually my response. lol let me guess, it\\u2019s too expensive. \\u201ci love it, you don\\u2019t have to. it\\u2019s not for everyone.\\u201d i don\\u2019t engage with people like this. it's okay. we don't want you here anyway. ngl i mostly live here because i work here and don't want to commute. my coworkers from li have asked me how i live here, i just ask them what time they had to wake up to get to work and what time they will get home. for them it's 4:10am then they get home around 5:30. i get up at 6:10 and am usually home before 3pm. on the weekends they are usually sleeping in to catch up on sleep, while i'm still waking up at 6:10 feeling refreshed, then head to the beach or mountains. please don\\u2019t then. we have enough problems. go and live somewhere where you\\u2019re happy and spare us your ignorant opinions \\\"i didn't choose to be born here.\\\" is what i've told people. because i didn't lol. is this new york the state or new york city. i love my small town in upstate new york. \\ud83c\\udfb6 \\ud83c\\udfb5 where everybody know your name...\\ud83c\\udfb6 suck my dick nod/smile/walk away \\u201cnobody cares\\u201d good we got enough people from the middle of nowhere making tik tok videos here \\u201cyeah, not everyone has what it takes to succeed here socially or economically\\u201d *silence* different strokes for different folks. no need to stoop to something haughty. the same as anywhere else they go to work eat poop reproduce and so on it\\u2019s a really great is what i say. but what i think is if you have to ask why nyc you do not only not belong there but you will never get it. this kind of comment is likely not a personal value judgement. nyc is an objectively difficult place to eke out an existence. there are many reasons why someone would say they can\\u2019t or don\\u2019t want to live here that are in no way derogatory. l + ratio + didn\\u2019t ask good. we are full it does completely suck right now, would leave if i could it's a hard city, but you're never bored. everyday feels like a movie good, there's too many people already. we have a housing shortage. i\\u2019m sorry there\\u2019s no more room. it's pretty much how everyone used to live unless you were a farmer. i feel bad for them. \\\"i didn't ask\\\" nyc isn\\u2019t for the weak so i understand only the strong survive i simply say \\\"i like it,\\\" but i'm thinking [this](https://youtube.com/clip/ugkxb82j_rahxxae3wboxd9robiivk7f_0r2?si=hgwt5vjwoa826fqx). ![gif](giphy|7k2loeyky5i1hfewqb) them:\\\"i could nev-\\\" me: \\\"hard agree\\\" a lot of bitter & sassy answers in this thread. it\\u2019s not a personal attack if someone doesn\\u2019t want to live here. i moved out of that toilet a long time ago wouldn\\u2019t go back for all the money in the world. good. \\u201ccan i get a #3 with a large soda?\\u201d i usually respond with curiosity. oh, what makes you say that? then if they offer a negative assumption that isn\\u2019t true (it\\u2019s too dangerous, etc) i say, oh that hasn\\u2019t been my experience and then they usually stop.  sometimes i\\u2019ll say oh yea i get it- i could never live in the rural midwest, we all have our preferences and that also usually stops them   honestly it\\u2019s fine if both everyone wants to live here but usually when people say that it\\u2019s with a critical edge so i try to shut it down then i guess you shouldn\\u2019t. honestly man\\u2026 i don\\u2019t know how i can even live here anymore.  it\\u2019s gotten exponentially harder to find a fucking apartment since the last time i moved.  i\\u2019ve been couch surfing and subletting since april and i\\u2019m completely over it. i have family who are native new yorkers and i\\u2019m an la native. we both still reside in our home towns. we laugh about it. they have a choice. stay where you are and why do you care where we live? we do not say anything about where they live. ny and la

response was   \\\"don't believe everything you see in movies or on the news. yes its true we have crime and our mayor sucks but there is more to ny than the 5 boroughs. alot of people live in very beautiful areas that are safe and only commute to manhattan for work\\\" i tell them we're glad not to have them. i agree: you couldn\\u2019t as someone from nyc i\\u2019d say i agree \\ud83e\\udd23 \\u201cyes, as a new yorker i can say it is pretty bad. stay out\\u201d. this way, hopefully, we can bring the rent down and enjoy our city with those who love it, like i do. to each their own

lippy puss nobody  who lives in the greatest  city in the universe cares..\\ud83d\\ude0a\\ud83d\\ude04\\ud83d\\ude01\\ud83d\\ude42 and plears,please...stay away,your not wanted  and we don't  need you!!!!!\\ud83d\\ude0e a lot of people find nyc overwhelming. i was born here so it's second nature. however, i went to pitt and didn't have a single friend from pittsburgh who successfully tried to transition to nyc. most lasted a year, some a bit longer. you love it or you don't that\\u2019s great, don\\u2019t good luck, babe \\u270c\\ufe0f i tell them they\\u2019re right. the city could do much better to take care of its constituents. i shrug and say it\\u2019s actually better when you live there. visiting can be stressful, but when you have home to get back to and you generally know your way around, it\\u2019s a great place to live. \\u201ci agree. it\\u2019s unlikely you would be able to make it out here.\\u201d not sure that requires any response. \\\"time is a construct and capitalism is killing us all, i don't know how people live anywhere.\\\" so don\\u2019t live here you\\u2019re so right! i have a couple of cousins who always make remarks about me living in nyc. i just tell them, \\\"it's not for the weak\\\" fuck off. i say i love the energy. it is the capital of the universe. the news o it reports on the crime. very safe. good, leave \\u201cyeah you\\u2019re right. you probably couldn\\u2019t \\u201c it\\u2019s not for everyone.   most nyers could never live in really rural areas; same concept. you don\\u2019t need a response. i just say it\\u2019s not for everybody.i remember a friend told me i need to move out of new york and how bad it is blah blah blah all because she moved to pennsylvania,so i told her it\\u2019s not that easy for me to move long story short she ended up getting evicted from her apartment and now she\\u2019s back in new york lol. \\u201cwhere else then?\\u201d awhile ago, we were afraid that you would move here! \\u201cf@ck otf\\u201d thank god because we don\\u2019t need people like you here lol good, stay out. i would scream that i agree \\\"yeah, you probably aren't strong enough\\\". but then they get all mad, so be ready if you say that. \\u201cthen don\\u2019t \\ud83d\\ude00\\u201d this aint for the weak.. keep enjoying  ohio brah i dig it i tell them its a real place with real people just like any other \\ud83d\\udc4d we lived in nyc for 2 decades as an adult including several years in midtown, after moving out, i don\\u2019t think i would want to live there even if someone gave a free apartment. \\\"i don't know either\\\" because it's true, i'm not cut out for it & at the same time i don't wanna leave... \\\"good.\\\" i mean good don\\u2019t fucking live here there\\u2019s almost 9 million people here. live in your boring suburb of dallas and tweet about your truck and freedom. shut the fuck up and stay there.

giving you a little insight into their preferences.  why is everyone always looking for a reason to be butt hurt?  look for a reason to be grateful, or find joy in things, and touch some grass in central park. we don\\u2019t want you here either \\\"i agree, this place sucks. wish i could leave\\\" yea i can see that you wouldn\\u2019t be a good fit there anyways \\u201ccool. don\\u2019t.\\u201d no need to take offense when people say that. a lot of people don't like the loud city environment and high rent. if you live in ny, you know it's not perfect. my sister says that to me all the time. most of the times, i just smile and change the topic.  but few times i have responded \\u201c i can't live at a place where i have to drive everywhere.  every ones different.\\u201d good! don\\u2019t! there\\u2019s already enough ohio transplants in zara jackets and baggy jeans clogging up the sidewalk. thank god, we dont need anyone like you \\u201cthat\\u2019s fine.\\u201d  i totally get it. it isn\\u2019t for everyone and that is okay. i love it. sometimes it feels like an abusive relationship, but it is hard to imagine living anywhere else unless it is also a large city where i don\\u2019t *need* a car. \\u201cdid someone ask you to live here?\\u201d \\\"you're right, you could never live here\\\" scrolling (not all the way so relax) are there any real answers? other than, \\\"no one asked you to\\\" or similar (by the way, those people make this place tough to live in \\ud83d\\ude02)   proximity to nyc, beaches, schools, family, road trip to most of east coast, great jobs? i can totally see why people live there, i just don't understand how you afford to good! it's already too crowded. *internally thinks to self* \\u201cidk how i live here either\\u201d i just say imagine california. \\ud83d\\ude02 \\u201cand that\\u2019s why you don\\u2019t\\u201d truuue i get don\\u2019t get why so many so called new yorkers here in the comments can\\u2019t imagine how life in nyc is objectively harder than if we lived anywhere else. like if someone said this to me i\\u2019d be like \\u201ci know! rent is crazy in nyc\\u201d   like it\\u2019s not a personal attack, it\\u2019s just true. it\\u2019s crazy dense, the rent is unbelievable the taxes wild, the proximity and density of humans per block is 5-10x any other us city.   for better or for worse yes we\\u2019re all here for a reason, but don\\u2019t pretend your quality of life would not improve if you left. it\\u2019s not always a put down if someone says they could never live here. it\\u2019s a lot! well it\\u2019s good you dont \\u201cit\\u2019s definitely not for the weak\\u201d yeah, but are the rats in oklahoma living like kings? didn\\u2019t think so. \\u201ci know, it\\u2019s a horrible city but it\\u2019s where my job is.\\u201d i would live in ny if i had the money to do it in style. think terrace instead of balcony. great. don\\u2019t. i lived in new york and i wish i listened to the people who told me this. the city is a shit-ridden scum factory. people weren't meant to live like that. i rightfully judge people who genuinely enjoy it. me neither then don\\u2019t. then don\\u2019t move here fine. there\\u2019s enough of us here already. shit ain\\u2019t easy out here my boy!!!!!! i sometimes think i wouldn't want to if i weren't a native.  but only every other day. just means i'm stronger than you why is this such a common thing for people to say?! i\\u2019ve had multiple people say that to me and i\\u2019m always so confused. i wouldn\\u2019t say that about where they live. depends but sometimes just a \\u201cthat\\u2019s awesome, glad you know that! i dont know how you could live here either. :)\\u201d to each their own. it\\u2019s not for the weak. the city doesn't need anymore transplants trying to live their best \\\"friends,\\\" \\\"sex and the city,\\\" or \\\"broad city\\\" lifestyle, so it's okay!\\ud83d\\udc4c\\ud83c\\udffe same. it\\u2019s an over expensive pile of litter and smells like garbage. cool museums and parks though and fun for day trips! you\\u2019re right; you couldn\\u2019t \\\"it's not for the weak\\\" are the majority of the people answering this question  transplants? how many people are talking to people that don't live here? most of friends and family are from here. how often are you guys getting asked this question? and by whom? \\u201ci respect your opinion.\\u201d i agree my response is always \\u201cyeah it sucks.\\u201d because it does. i\\u2019m convinced most of you have a fantasy image of what this city is based on movies and tv that clouds your perception of reality.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

nyc is one of the most culturally-rich cities in the world. you can find any cuisine in many forms, from street vendor to michelin star restaurant. fantastic music venues, museums, shops, bars, parks, etc. you could pick one part of brooklyn and do everything that is offered in an entire city in america.  i\\u2019m exaggerating a bit, but it\\u2019s mostly true. nyc has plenty of problems like any major city. it\\u2019s expensive, sometimes dirty, untreated mental illness, but, the community and culture is worth it in my opinion. 9 million people do. so my response is typically,  \\\"have you ever been there before?\\\"  and i wait to hear what they have to say.   i've driven around the entire united states, and the one thing i learned is this:   **if you are from nyc, you don't understand how the rest of the country functions. and if you are not from nyc, you have no idea how nyc functions.**   something i can only say after driving around the country in a van, doing touring theatre, hanging out with audience members, and trying to live out of motels. depends on who is saying it and if they are being condescending while expressing their views. they are many parts of living here that are awful, exclusionary, and unsafe that may drive me out of the city in the future despite having built a full life here me: \\\"i agree.\\\"  i just... there are some things to \\\\*like\\\\* about nyc, but there are a lot of things to \\\\*loathe\\\\* about nyc  that's just me. i know a lot of people can live a pretty steady, consistent life in here with very little trouble. i admire and honestly am jealous bye.  the door is to the left.  see you never. i hope you're happy where you land. \\u201cyeah, you couldn\\u2019t\\u201d me too i miss ny a lot! moved to dallas a few months ago and i want to go back haha i can\\u2019t find the same parks here, can\\u2019t find the same quality food at restaurants, everything is better in ny.  it\\u2019s definitely more stinky in some places in ny but that\\u2019s city life, if people don\\u2019t like city life they wouldn\\u2019t like many walking cities honestly. it\\u2019s funny how it js socially acceptable to say \\u201ci could never live in (big city)\\u201d but if you say \\u201ci could never live in (suburban town)\\u201d you\\u2019re being rude. i just nod and agree with them.   a. i want to keep rent down b. i've made my own life out for myself here are the last 5 years and if i wanted people from my rural hometown in my regular life still i would've moved back home. i grew up in iowa so i completely understand as far as cleanliness, environment, physical space, quiet etc. but personally i was bored outta my damn mind there and they really can't comprehend the lifestyle you live out here. ya you\\u2019re right, you couldn\\u2019t i usually say i could never live where they live. okay would you like to list anything else you don\\u2019t do? should i start listing the things i don\\u2019t do? sorry i\\u2019m not so good with weird conversations. why would i care? i can never live in any random suburb but they sure do \\\"i don't know how you can live here.\\\" anyone that has said this to me hasn\\u2019t ever even visited new york good, rent is expensive enough. can you imagine if everyone wanted to live here? \\u201cyeah i don\\u2019t think you could either\\u201d i get it, you don't have the mental fortitude :) new york is devastated by you not being there it takes a certain kind of person to live here. sometimes i wonder whether i am cut out for it. but it is the city that puts all others to shame. i can walk out my door and never hop in a car or even a train and do all of my grocery shopping, go to the gym, sit and read by the waterfront or in a nearby park, decide on dinner at 20 restaurants 300 feet away, and watch the lights flicker on just as the sun sets. i can hear 5 different languages just walking to get breakfast. i have my choice of 10 different coffee shops to do wfh. i can thrift free art and furniture right off the street. maybe there\\u2019s a city or two in europe that could, perhaps, match some of the vibes i get here. but if i were a betting man, my money would always be on the sui generis of cities. \\u201ci know, i can tell\\u201d and look at them smugly. it\\u2019s interesting that this is such a common comment - i would never think to turn to someone who lives in kansas and declare that i could never live how they live. it would be so condescending for me to say that as a new yorker, but somehow the reverse is not\\u2026? maybe because it\\u2019s \\u201cpunching up\\u201d aka the city is so obviously desirable there\\u2019s a reason so many of the world\\u2019s most popular shows and movies take place here and it\\u2019s packed to the gills with people trying to make it here. for this reason i usually shrug it off as little sister behavior. ![gif](giphy|j8fzim9vobu6q) yeah it\\u2019s not for the weak the city weeds out the bitches. \\u201ci could never live in *insert town or suburb where they live*. i don\\u2019t know how people can live there.\\u201d \\u201cnot surprised\\u201d okay would you like to list anything else you don\\u2019t do? should i start listing the things i don\\u2019t do? sorry i\\u2019m not so good with weird conversations. my cousin who lives in a trailer in bumfuck, backwoods usa said he could never live here and i just laughed and replied \\u201coh i agree, this city isn\\u2019t for the weak.\\u201d some people aren\\u2019t built to handle how tough it is either \\u201cyeah, i don\\u2019t think you could either\\u201d or \\u201ci couldn\\u2019t live where you live either\\u201d \\ud83d\\ude02 \\u201c8.3 million people live here so its actually not that hard?\\u201d don\\u2019t. a friend and his wife were flabbergasted when i told them that after a weekend of complaining how much they would never live in nyc while crashing at my place. not with that attitude! yeah you probably couldn\\u2019t. \\\"who says we want you here?\\\" this is a classic republican/trump attitude, so i view it as very political. \\\"i'm sorry your mental weakness is drowning out your statement, please rephrase \\\" \\ud83e\\udd37\\ud83c\\udffb\\u200d\\u2642\\ufe0f you\\u2019re right, you couldn\\u2019t. \\u201cis that not a rude thing to say where you\\u2019re from?\\u201d good thing nobody\\u2019s inviting you. only the strongest survives new york. i'd say, you don't know what you're talking about. fuck you!\\u00a0 or \\\"to each, his own\\\" i say \\u201cgood\\u201d we don\\u2019t want you here. you weren\\u2019t invited then don\\u2019t there\\u2019s only one answer. \\u201cfuggisyoutalmbout?\\u201d you either love it or hate it! it\\u2019s great that you don\\u2019t then :) i tell them nyc has 8 million people so maybe you should stfu and learn something ![gif](giphy|j8fzim9vobu6q) then dont shut up  go sit over there  please go away \\u201cyeah you definitely couldn\\u2019t!\\u201d my mom always says this. great, you\\u2019ve chosen where you want to live and i\\u2019ve chosen where i ant to live. i don\\u2019t spend all my time telling you how much i hate where you live why do you do it to me lol i say. fuck you. you want to but you can\\u2019t it\\u2019s usually some fools stuck in an echo chamber of disinformation showing random photos of fire, broken windows, and wrecked police cars from 2020. but yeah, no place like ny. i travel quite a bit, have had to move all over for work, and i always miss ny in the end. don\\u2019t let the door hit you in the ass! adios!!! you have to be tough to live in new york a friend of mine lived in new york city had a dog named taxi. \\u201cyeah, it\\u2019s not for everybody.\\u201d tell them they probably wouldn\\u2019t be happy here and they should stay where they are. i moved to brooklyn in 2006-straight from college and been here since. could not imagine living anywhere else!!! go fuck yourself! we aren't exactly \\\"living\\\" ![gif](giphy|1msy0o1ma3bslybzua|downsized) ![gif](giphy|ldbuyzawu8l4i|downsized)  \\\"then, don't\\\" the people who say this would so obviously get eaten alive that i\\u2019m not bothered anymore. they can keep thinking that when you live in nyc there\\u2019s someone lurking around every corner to stab you and no one speaks english or whatever fb told them. at least i make more than $7/hour and i have the option to fuck someone who isn\\u2019t my second cousin. that's fine. say don\\u2019t. you have no idea what you\\u2019re missing. i lived here my whole life. and love it \\\"you can't handle it, it's okay.\\\" i agree. [deleted] \\\"i'm here, in one piece and as financially ranked as the rest of us.\\\" same probably you get used to it.  (i'm a transplant) \\ud83d\\udc4d\\ud83c\\udffd \\u201cya know, that reminds me of an old yogi berra saying\\u201d \\\"me neither, can i leave?\\\" good i know ok then. it's not for everyone and honestly a lot of people complain about creature comforts. i always thought of it as look at the city as your extended living room and you've got every opportunity open to you.  it's not some peoples cup of tea and that's perfectly ok.   i mean, i could never live in new jersey. \\ud83d\\ude43 https://preview.redd.it/ay8qe0graiid1.jpeg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=922157c92e472d2f8b90ce9ad6e3c64a1d5380aa  i be like cool i'll enjoy this view regardless. good the rents too damn high already \\ud83e\\udd37\\ud83c\\udffb\\u200d\\u2640\\ufe0f \\u201ci hate driving.\\u201d \\\"lol same. i like the quality of life though. could never live where you do\\\" nyc has the highest high and lowest lows. i love what makes it great way more than disdain what makes it challenging. \\u201cyeah i completely get you, a lot of people i know can\\u2019t afford it too\\u201d cool. i can\\u2019t live in gaithersburg either.  (actual convo with a friend of mine from maryland) i don't know how i live here either. slow blink and stare. my response is basically what others have commented, \\\"ok\\\". but i sometimes think i should have answered, \\\"why does someone living in new york make you feel the need to defend not living in new york?\\\" great, don't. it\\u2019s not for the weak \\u201cfacts. idk how i live here\\u201d \\u201cthat\\u2019s because your a lil bitch\\u201d we're full anyways \\ud83e\\udd23 well...i don't know how anyone can live here. note: where ever they live. go kick rocks! but also ok good! we don\\u2019t want no more transplants lol i mean i\\u2019ve lived here for 10 years and own a house in brooklyn and i still kind of feel like i can\\u2019t live here the first thing to remember when someone says this is it has nothing to do with you. they are just stating their preference (even if not worded well). so just don't take it personally.  everyone has preferences. usually i say something like \\\"i hear you\\\" which validates / witnesses their point of view without giving up mine. aaaaaannnnnnndddddd? i\\u2019ve always believed myself a better human for having lived there. ight ok boomer it is helpful to know why they say that. if it\\u2019s money, it\\u2019s rhetorical. but sometimes it\\u2019s bc it seems overwhelming, too big, too anonymous\\u2014to which i say, but each neighborhood is a small enclave. you get to know your local small grocer on the corner, your mail person, etc. and then when you walk further out, there\\u2019s the vital energy. you start to know which streets to walk, for when you want low-key energy and a direct passage. then another day, you want the variety and the hustle and bustle. i always feel seen in ny, and i equally *see* so many people. a main reason why i love it. give me your wallet! yeah rats are an acquired taste \\u201ci could visit the m&m store but i couldn\\u2019t live in the m&m store\\u201d cool lol but also same because it\\u2019s so unreal here lol when i'm feeling spicy: \\\"yeah, you gotta be tough and smart. not everyone can handle it. nothing wrong with that.\\\"   the last part being said in a tone of voice that insinuates there is, in fact, something wrong with that. *shrugs* \\u201cso don\\u2019t\\u201d get the f out in god speed there is a great new song by morgan st jean - \\u201cme this time.\\u201d  choosing nyc over a relationship.  i would play it for them mofo leave lol new york is always two decades ahead...imo \\u201cnyc is more than just time square and midtown.\\u201d \\\"i understand\\\" \\\"i agree\\\" the patrice o'neal head tilt/shoulder shrug but with the absolute minimum effort possible. of course you couldn't, dear (smiles sympathetically) i send them this video  https://youtu.be/tnpoplflt1w?si=gkripvvihmx4a0hr stay where you\\u2019re comfortable. i\\u2019m going to explore and discover myself. tell them to enjoy olive garden and everything closing at 8pm, we dont miss you it\\u2019s not for everyone i would never live in the suburbs of [atlanta / dallas / charlotte] k cool okay \\u201csame\\u201d there are more than a million people who disagree more for me ppl are always going to have something to say that could rub you the wrong way. it\\u2019s annoying but i\\u2019ve learned to just not engage. shrug your shoulders, nod, and move on to the next topic. \\u201cso anyway\\u2026\\u201d ppl aren\\u2019t going to change their opinions and you\\u2019re better off letting it go than letting it aggravate you.  don\\u2019t waste your time or energy! just my 2 cents! \\\"that's fair.\\\" because they probably have a point of two that is legitimate and probably not being confrontational perse. everyone has their preferences. why they decided to blurt that out loud depends on the situation i guess. why make care payments or car insurance payments or gasoline payments when everything is a block away folks in my hometown often say that but i think they mean it as a compliment, rather than an insult.   as i interpret it, they found the hustle and bustle of new york intimidating when they visited, so they are \\u201cin awe\\u201d (heavy air quotes there - i\\u2019m not so narcissistic i think they\\u2019re actually awed by me) of my ability to handle the grit, the trains, the noise, the directness, etc.   i tend to respond, \\u201coh i love it, it\\u2019s been a great fit for me.\\u201d keeps my pride intact without being dismissive. good. \\u201cyeop, only some people can take it.\\u201d being this poor must suck a lot of people won't admit what they don't know.\\u00a0 good for them for admitting it. good thing it\\u2019s me and not you \\u201cgood thing you don\\u2019t\\u201d \\u201ci don\\u2019t know how i could live here myself, still trying to figure that out\\u201d laughter i get it. this place kinda sucks. i mean i can totally see why someone wouldn\\u2019t want to live here. it\\u2019s not for everyone and as someone who\\u2019s lived here most of my life it does get frustrating sometimes. i moved from a quiet neighborhood in the midwest to new york and my response is \\u201ceh, ya get used to it after a bit\\u201d \\u201cyeah i get it. that\\u2019s how i feel about the suburbs\\u201d i tell them \\u201cthat\\u2019s great, bc i could never live where you live either.\\u201d and just look at their face, waiting for the irony to hit. \\u201cwell millions of people do so it must work somehow!\\u201d same! want to grab a coffee at park and 125th? i tell them i can't wait to get out too. then don\\u2019t - we have enough people already\\ud83d\\ude00 \\u201cprobably for the best. you\\u2019re not strong enough to handle it anyway\\u201d \\\"that was always allowed\\\" my husband agrees with them and says \\u201cyeah, you wouldn\\u2019t make it here.\\u201d \\u201cyeah, i totally hear you\\u201d  lifelong manhattanite going on 53, i get why people say that. it\\u2019s such a specific lifestyle. \\u201cyea, it\\u2019s not for everyone\\u201d that\\u2019s why the city is so empty! \\u201cnot everyone can live here\\u201d lmao \\u201cthe struggle is real.\\u201d this tickled me. just moved back to manhattan with my husband and four year old after a decade in the burbs. i don't know why everyone is so offended by this question. there's lots of places i wouldn't live either and would say the exact same thing about. that\\u2019s ok, it\\u2019s just not for you, don\\u2019t blame yourself. yeah, it\\u2019s not for everyone we don\\u2019t want you. nothing. i don\\u2019t care. \\u201cyeah, ny would probably eat you alive. it\\u2019s not for everyone.\\u201d \\u201ci don\\u2019t know how i live here either.\\u201d \\\"i dont blame you, it sucks\\\" the irony of wanting to live in nyc when i was broke vs being able to afford it now and not wanting to \\ud83d\\ude02 it\\u2019s funny how people say stuff like that not even knowing how nyc is or have never been there\\u2026. i agree i tell them - please go - makes more room for the people who truly want to be here. i tell them there is a waiting list for almost all apts. in ny and if there isn't then there is something wrong with the apt.   i tell people that the trick in life is to find a place where you like to live  - and then live there. \\u201cgood. new york is pretty full.\\u201d \\u201cit aint for everybody\\u201d + \\ud83e\\udd37\\ud83c\\udffd\\u200d\\u2640\\ufe0f then it\\u2019s a good thing you don\\u2019t! my response is i don\\u2019t blame you that\\u2019s a feature, not a bug there's a reason it's in every type of media to each their own. it\\u2019s def not for everyone. some people like space and peace and quiet. others want to live in the middle of all the action.  it\\u2019s a weird trend where everyone has to attack or defend where they live. if you like it there who gives af lol my wife and i moved back in february after 14 very pleasant years in the charleston suburbs. liked it well enough there, but always felt like this was home, could never really lean hard into life there. my standard response is \\\"it's not for everybody.\\\" there are plenty of things that suck about living here, i'm not totally sure this was the right call for us in our middle age years, but..like everywhere else would feel like i was on the outside looking in. literally 10-20 million people exist here just fine. most of the entire globe lives in places like nyc \\ud83e\\udd37\\ud83c\\udffe\\u200d\\u2640\\ufe0f then don\\u2019t i don\\u2019t know how i live here either well it depends where. i live eastern long island and it's expensive but so beautiful i wouldn't want to live anywhere else did i ask you? \\\"sir, this is a wendy's\\\" that\\u2019s right. you couldn\\u2019t. so many people scared of nyc for little reason. imo only drawback is cost of living. \\u201coh yeah, not everyone\\u2019s mentally strong enough to live in the city. good for you for knowing that about yourself.\\u201d non-condescending: \\u201ck\\u201d. condescending: \\u201cnot everyone can handle it\\u201d.  ultra-condescending: \\u201cactually, i really love it here. i\\u2019m so happy.\\u201d \\u201cthat\\u2019s how i feel about *insert their town*\\u201d i live in ny and as soon as i complete my latest project i am out of here and away from houckle. i agree with them. \\u201cokay lol i agree ig\\u201d native nyer here, i get it. nyc is like david lynch movies, i think they are beautiful, fascinating, and often disturbing masterpieces, but i totally get that some people just wouldn\\u2019t like them at all or find them appealing in any way. \\u201cwe built different\\u201d \\\"yeah only certain kind of people can live here. it has its own way of weeding out the weak\\\" \\u201csame, and i\\u2019ve lived there 24 years\\u201d well stay where you are then. don\\u2019t worry bout it sweetheart. you don't have to respond. let people live in their little world. i agree im not asking for a roomate, uncle mark \\u201ci didn\\u2019t ask\\u201d or \\u201cyeah, a lot of people can\\u2019t hack it!\\u201d mind ya business \\\"okay leave\\\" i know this place is a shit hole \\u201ci get that\\u201d \\u201cyou\\u2019re right, you definitely couldn\\u2019t handle it here\\u201d i say i understand. i only came here for the art as an artist but that whole crowd is snooty political and male dominated and disgusting so about to leave after 20 years. sick of the abuse and anger, commutes. i feel like the art meca will not be here. a more annoying question is, how do you live there, homeless, dangerous, and so small good literally nothing because i don\\u2019t care. just smile. i will tell him straight to his face - \\u201cyou.. you.. you are totally right and the city became garbage\\u201d don\\u2019t come \\\"yeah, i can tell.\\\" whenever tourists at my job say this i just respond with \\u201cwow. devastating.\\u201d provincial snowflakes, they scared of chocolate colored people good! it's too crowded as it is. good to know your limits i grew up in la and have lived in new york for almost 20 years. i fairly often have a dodgers or lakers hat on and new yorkers fairly often tell me how much they hate la.   i\\u2019ve found that responding with \\u201cif i wanted your opinion i would have asked you\\u201d works pretty well.   same thing works here. you don\\u2019t have to make it about where they live, you just have to remind them that just because they have an opinion doesn\\u2019t mean they need to share it. \\\"cause i work here\\\" is usually my response. lol let me guess, it\\u2019s too expensive. \\u201ci love it, you don\\u2019t have to. it\\u2019s not for everyone.\\u201d i don\\u2019t engage with people like this. it's okay. we don't want you here anyway. ngl i mostly live here because i work here and don't want to commute. my coworkers from li have asked me how i live here, i just ask them what time they had to wake up to get to work and what time they will get home. for them it's 4:10am then they get home around 5:30. i get up at 6:10 and am usually home before 3pm. on the weekends they are usually sleeping in to catch up on sleep, while i'm still waking up at 6:10 feeling refreshed, then head to the beach or mountains. please don\\u2019t then. we have enough problems. go and live somewhere where you\\u2019re happy and spare us your ignorant opinions \\\"i didn't choose to be born here.\\\" is what i've told people. because i didn't lol. is this new york the state or new york city. i love my small town in upstate new york. \\ud83c\\udfb6 \\ud83c\\udfb5 where everybody know your name...\\ud83c\\udfb6 suck my dick nod/smile/walk away \\u201cnobody cares\\u201d good we got enough people from the middle of nowhere making tik tok videos here \\u201cyeah, not everyone has what it takes to succeed here socially or economically\\u201d *silence* different strokes for different folks. no need to stoop to something haughty. the same as anywhere else they go to work eat poop reproduce and so on it\\u2019s a really great is what i say. but what i think is if you have to ask why nyc you do not only not belong there but you will never get it. this kind of comment is likely not a personal value judgement. nyc is an objectively difficult place to eke out an existence. there are many reasons why someone would say they can\\u2019t or don\\u2019t want to live here that are in no way derogatory. l + ratio + didn\\u2019t ask good. we are full it does completely suck right now, would leave if i could it's a hard city, but you're never bored. everyday feels like a movie good, there's too many people already. we have a housing shortage. i\\u2019m sorry there\\u2019s no more room. it's pretty much how everyone used to live unless you were a farmer. i feel bad for them. \\\"i didn't ask\\\" nyc isn\\u2019t for the weak so i understand only the strong survive i simply say \\\"i like it,\\\" but i'm thinking [this](https://youtube.com/clip/ugkxb82j_rahxxae3wboxd9robiivk7f_0r2?si=hgwt5vjwoa826fqx). ![gif](giphy|7k2loeyky5i1hfewqb) them:\\\"i could nev-\\\" me: \\\"hard agree\\\" a lot of bitter & sassy answers in this thread. it\\u2019s not a personal attack if someone doesn\\u2019t want to live here. i moved out of that toilet a long time ago wouldn\\u2019t go back for all the money in the world. good. \\u201ccan i get a #3 with a large soda?\\u201d i usually respond with curiosity. oh, what makes you say that? then if they offer a negative assumption that isn\\u2019t true (it\\u2019s too dangerous, etc) i say, oh that hasn\\u2019t been my experience and then they usually stop.  sometimes i\\u2019ll say oh yea i get it- i could never live in the rural midwest, we all have our preferences and that also usually stops them   honestly it\\u2019s fine if both everyone wants to live here but usually when people say that it\\u2019s with a critical edge so i try to shut it down then i guess you shouldn\\u2019t. honestly man\\u2026 i don\\u2019t know how i can even live here anymore.  it\\u2019s gotten exponentially harder to find a fucking apartment since the last time i moved.  i\\u2019ve been couch surfing and subletting since april and i\\u2019m completely over it. i have family who are native new yorkers and i\\u2019m an la native. we both still reside in our home towns. we laugh about it. they have a choice. stay where you are and why do you care where we live? we do not say anything about where they live. ny and la are always the bullseye on the dartboard. oh well. we don\\u2019t want you to live here either. not everyone can \\ud83d\\udc81\\ud83c\\udffb\\u200d\\u2640\\ufe0f i was born and raised here; i agree with them this place is a dump. good. good. don\\u2019t come here, we have enough real new yorkers already living here. that i hate it to and feel stuck here to the people who have asked me that, my response was   \\\"don't believe everything you see in movies or on the news. yes its true we have crime and our mayor sucks but there is more to ny than the 5 boroughs. alot of people live in very beautiful areas that are safe and only commute to manhattan for work\\\" i tell them we're glad not to have them. i agree: you couldn\\u2019t as someone from nyc i\\u2019d say i agree \\ud83e\\udd23 \\u201cyes, as a new yorker i can say it is pretty bad. stay out\\u201d. this way, hopefully, we can bring the rent down and enjoy our city with those who love it, like i do. to each their own that\\u2019s great, but if you can make it in new york baby, you can make it anywhere. maybe you\\u2019re just not cut out to be a boss you weren\\u2019t even invited \\u2764\\ufe0f stop being a big lippy puss nobody  who lives in the greatest  city in the universe cares..\\ud83d\\ude0a\\ud83d\\ude04\\ud83d\\ude01\\ud83d\\ude42 and plears,please...stay away,your not wanted  and we don't  need you!!!!!\\ud83d\\ude0e a lot of people find nyc overwhelming. i was born here so it's second nature. however, i went to pitt and didn't have a single friend from pittsburgh who successfully tried to transition to nyc. most lasted a year, some a bit longer. you love it or you don't that\\u2019s great, don\\u2019t good luck, babe \\u270c\\ufe0f i tell them they\\u2019re right. the city could do much better to take care of its constituents. i shrug and say it\\u2019s actually better when you live there. visiting can be stressful, but when you have home to get back to and you generally know your way around, it\\u2019s a great place to live. \\u201ci agree. it\\u2019s unlikely you would be able to make it out here.\\u201d not sure that requires any response. \\\"time is a construct and capitalism is killing us all, i don't know how people live anywhere.\\\" so don\\u2019t live here you\\u2019re so right! i have a couple of cousins who always make remarks about me living in nyc. i just tell them, \\\"it's not for the weak\\\" fuck off. i say i love the energy. it is the capital of the universe. the news o it reports on the crime. very safe. good, leave \\u201cyeah you\\u2019re right. you probably couldn\\u2019t \\u201c it\\u2019s not for everyone.   most nyers could never live in really rural areas; same concept. you don\\u2019t need a response. i just say it\\u2019s not for everybody.i remember a friend told me i need to move out of new york and how bad it is blah blah blah all because she moved to pennsylvania,so i told her it\\u2019s not that easy for me to move long story short she ended up getting evicted from her apartment and now she\\u2019s back in new york lol. \\u201cwhere else then?\\u201d awhile ago, we were afraid that you would move here! \\u201cf@ck otf\\u201d thank god because we don\\u2019t need people like you here lol good, stay out. i would scream that i agree \\\"yeah, you probably aren't strong enough\\\". but then they get all mad, so be ready if you say that. \\u201cthen don\\u2019t \\ud83d\\ude00\\u201d this aint for the weak.. keep enjoying  ohio brah i dig it i tell them its a real place with real people just like any other \\ud83d\\udc4d we lived in nyc for 2 decades as an adult including several years in midtown, after moving out, i don\\u2019t think i would want to live there even if someone gave a free apartment. \\\"i don't know either\\\" because it's true, i'm not cut out for it & at the same time i don't wanna leave... \\\"good.\\\" i mean good don\\u2019t fucking live here there\\u2019s almost 9 million people here. live in your boring suburb of dallas and tweet about your truck and freedom. shut the fuck up and stay there.

giving you a little insight into their preferences.  why is everyone always looking for a reason to be butt hurt?  look for a reason to be grateful, or find joy in things, and touch some grass in central park. we don\\u2019t want you here either \\\"i agree, this place sucks. wish i could leave\\\" yea i can see that you wouldn\\u2019t be a good fit there anyways \\u201ccool. don\\u2019t.\\u201d no need to take offense when people say that. a lot of people don't like the loud city environment and high rent. if you live in ny, you know it's not perfect. my sister says that to me all the time. most of the times, i just smile and change the topic.  but few times i have responded \\u201c i can't live at a place where i have to drive everywhere.  every ones different.\\u201d good! don\\u2019t! there\\u2019s already enough ohio transplants in zara jackets and baggy jeans clogging up the sidewalk. thank god, we dont need anyone like you \\u201cthat\\u2019s fine.\\u201d  i totally get it. it isn\\u2019t for everyone and that is okay. i love it. sometimes it feels like an abusive relationship, but it is hard to imagine living anywhere else unless it is also a large city where i don\\u2019t *need* a car. \\u201cdid someone ask you to live here?\\u201d \\\"you're right, you could never live here\\\" scrolling (not all the way so relax) are there any real answers? other than, \\\"no one asked you to\\\" or similar (by the way, those people make this place tough to live in \\ud83d\\ude02)   proximity to nyc, beaches, schools, family, road trip to most of east coast, great jobs? i can totally see why people live there, i just don't understand how you afford to good! it's already too crowded. *internally thinks to self* \\u201cidk how i live here either\\u201d i just say imagine california. \\ud83d\\ude02 \\u201cand that\\u2019s why you don\\u2019t\\u201d truuue i get don\\u2019t get why so many so called new yorkers here in the comments can\\u2019t imagine how life in nyc is objectively harder than if we lived anywhere else. like if someone said this to me i\\u2019d be like \\u201ci know! rent is crazy in nyc\\u201d   like it\\u2019s not a personal attack, it\\u2019s just true. it\\u2019s crazy dense, the rent is unbelievable the taxes wild, the proximity and density of humans per block is 5-10x any other us city.   for better or for worse yes we\\u2019re all here for a reason, but don\\u2019t pretend your quality of life would not improve if you left. it\\u2019s not always a put down if someone says they could never live here. it\\u2019s a lot! well it\\u2019s good you dont \\u201cit\\u2019s definitely not for the weak\\u201d yeah, but are the rats in oklahoma living like kings? didn\\u2019t think so. \\u201ci know, it\\u2019s a horrible city but it\\u2019s where my job is.\\u201d i would live in ny if i had the money to do it in style. think terrace instead of balcony. great. don\\u2019t. i lived in new york and i wish i listened to the people who told me this. the city is a shit-ridden scum factory. people weren't meant to live like that. i rightfully judge people who genuinely enjoy it. me neither then don\\u2019t. then don\\u2019t move here fine. there\\u2019s enough of us here already. shit ain\\u2019t easy out here my boy!!!!!! i sometimes think i wouldn't want to if i weren't a native.  but only every other day. just means i'm stronger than you why is this such a common thing for people to say?! i\\u2019ve had multiple people say that to me and i\\u2019m always so confused. i wouldn\\u2019t say that about where they live. depends but sometimes just a \\u201cthat\\u2019s awesome, glad you know that! i dont know how you could live here either. :)\\u201d to each their own. it\\u2019s not for the weak. the city doesn't need anymore transplants trying to live their best \\\"friends,\\\" \\\"sex and the city,\\\" or \\\"broad city\\\" lifestyle, so it's okay!\\ud83d\\udc4c\\ud83c\\udffe same. it\\u2019s an over expensive pile of litter and smells like garbage. cool museums and parks though and fun for day trips! you\\u2019re right; you couldn\\u2019t \\\"it's not for the weak\\\" are the majority of the people answering this question  transplants? how many people are talking to people that don't live here? most of friends and family are from here. how often are you guys getting asked this question? and by whom? \\u201ci respect your opinion.\\u201d i agree my response is always \\u201cyeah it sucks.\\u201d because it does. i\\u2019m convinced most of you have a fantasy image of what this city is based on movies and tv that clouds your perception of reality.\",\n          \"this has been happening for years but its reach is even wider today. nyc for the less wealthy are offered \\u201cglorified dorms.\\u201d the use the cheapest material, most confusing layouts and tiniest of rooms, but oh! there\\u2019s a pet spa on the roof \\ud83d\\ude44 you must be new here. and you left out one important thing...closets!!! people need closets. anything that doesn't fit in your closets has to be in your living space. i've seen some new apartments in brooklyn, overpriced but doable for me, but tiny closets. so frustrating \\ud83d\\ude24 looking now. good income/credit but a dismal experience. i went to an open house in the ev today, and 50 people showed up. a 150 sf apt; the studio room was so small the frig was squeezed between the (full/double) bed and the wall. 2200. wtf. i applied for a place slightly bigger, les, not great at all; it's been a week since they haven't answered my app. they asked for more financial information, which i gave them. they are obviously going from the richest applicant on down. i'm in a nice airbnb, a beautiful place, and same price as a regular apt but deep bk....ugh damn bro. you didn\\u2019t have to call out my living situation like that lmao i looked at an apartment once. it was gorgeous and was being subletted by the owner (which was a turn off to me anyway because i didn\\u2019t want to deal with that). and there was no refrigerator. actually there were two \\u201cmini fridges\\u201d the type i had in my dorm in college. how does one function without a fridge? for 3,000 a month?! insane you are correct on all of the above. i am moving into a much older apartment next month. you forgot about the lack of kitchens in these new buildings. i have yet to see a new apartment with a proper kitchen. it's always just kitchen stuff along one wall in the living room. what's next? a toilet in the corner of the bedroom? yes. >*it's like the developers tried to squeeze in just one too many units per floor which ended up making the square footage of all the units on the floor borderline unlivable.*  correct. i think one of the issues is that a large part of the market for these apartments are young people with roommates and who don't really care too much about long-term quality-of-life, or life inside their home when nyc is out there waiting for them, or having a reasonable budget that will allow them to live long-term (whether they're kind of yoloing on their own salary or have family assistance to pay the rent).  >*legitimately, how the fuck does anyone making less than 100k per year survive in this city?*  they probably do not live in new builds. lots of people will live in multiple-income households one way or another. and they hunt for deals and pounce on them immediately. and of course, dual or more incomes help a lot compared to a single income.  my first and longest-occupied apartment in nyc was a large one-bedroom in a rent-stabilized 1920's pre-war elevator tenement building in brooklyn. it usually didn't have cockroaches or mice, and it was pretty large, good light, on the top floor, and in reasonable condition, so i loved it. however, it was pretty crappy by anywhere-else standards. plus they're hard to get into. i got very lucky.  my wife and i live in a less-than-20-year-old condo-style building now, and it's nice and affordable for our income today, but it was a very, very lucky find. the broker half-joked that she loved showing this apartment because it was actually adult-sized.  most of our friends are pretty reasonably paid professionals, lots of couples, and my wife and i are the closest to living in a \\\"luxury\\\" new build of anyone at this point. friends live in older tenement-style buildings or partial brownstones.  the older the stock gets, the more it tends to be adult-livable and was better constructed. a lot of this is survivorship bias as much as anything... anything built to very low standards a hundred years ago was probably knocked down fifty years ago.  >*hopefully this city gets it together and eventually starts building way more apartments (with actually livable floor plans).*  yeah, i hope so. in the meantime dig around in queens and brooklyn for something older. make a list of your must-haves and dealbreakers and focus on things other people hate that you don't mind.  when my wife and i started dating she had a nice deal on a one-bedroom by herself because it was on the sixth floor of a non-elevator building. i had a goth friend who lived in manhattan long ago and really liked living in a dark cave, so she got a good deal on a low-floor courtyard apartment. given the timeframe, they were both making around today's equivalent of $80k taking inflation into account.  was still tough for both of them given the pay at the time, but they made it work living alone.  when i first moved here, the broker showed me a similar dark-cave ground-floor interior apartment for like 2/3 the price of the one i eventually lived in. but that was a dealbreaker for me.  if you make significantly less than $80k in today's dollars, and are just moving to nyc, i think many people are looking at roommates/housemates, family (living with them or getting help from), or incredible luck.  my first building was full of retirees and working people who could afford their rent-stabilized places partially because they'd been there a long, long time. i think my next-door neighbor had lived there for 45 years and raised her kids there. she was a retired emergency-room nurse.  rent stabilization/control is a good thing imo, for long-term life, but yeah, we also need significant up-market construction of good quality housing to take the pressure off for people who want to move here now. this is why you always want to find an apt in a pre war building. solid walls and larger rooms. saw a $1 million condo in queens a few years ago that was new construction and same thing. not even a deeded parking spot for that price and no parking near the building i\\u2019ve been living in new builds / luxury apts for 5 years and i\\u2019m so so excited to move to a pre war. there so much bs to deal with in a big luxury building including an incompetent management plus everything you mentioned.   the only luxury buildings that seem worth in are in bk or manhattan and even then there\\u2019s only certain buildings that are really good\\u2014 and studios in those buildings are at least 3.8k so here we are. honestly, i prefer prewar buildings. high ceilings and large bedrooms all the way. on top of it, they all lie about their square footage on the listings lmao welcome to late stage capitalism first time? roommate if you don\\u2019t make atleast 150k.  manhattan is a terrible place to live unless you\\u2019re making bank. go live outside of manhattan.  three types of ppl that lives in manhattan: 1) high earners 2) out of state folks that watches sex and the city  3) government housing folks. look for older buildings, over 100 yrs, in queens, bronx or brooklyn for large size rooms and apartments. the only way to afford it nowadays is to split rent with a partner (or roommate) and live 1-2 hours' commuting distance to manhattan.  my partner and i had a decent place in nj for a year, but the commute through port authority took years off my life, so we ultimately ended up in rockaway park, which is nice because it's at the beach, but it's like 1.5 hour from anywhere.  we rent the second floor of a single-family home from our landlord who lives below us.  we only got a good deal for this reason--we went through craiglist instead of an agency.  no fees or bullshit, and he never raises the rent.  unless you can get lucky with a private landlord, it's hell. this isn't just nyc. it's all new developer led construction in the country. look at places queens /brooklyn. not cheap but you get more space for your money. everyone wants to live in manhattan and there\\u2019s only so much space. as a liver in one of those weird apartments (housing connect so worth) if you can add door shelves and organization stuff from wayfair etc to the closet, it can become the dresser for you. makes no difference functionally (might be easier to find things too) and not having to place a big dresser helps the rest of the apartment layout fall in place. landed yesterday? 150sf?  for the whole place? that's 12'x 12' . my kid has a 600sf  in sutton place at that price point always has been \\ud83c\\udf0e\\ud83e\\uddd1\\u200d\\ud83d\\ude80 \\ud83d\\udd2b\\ud83d\\udc68\\ud83c\\udffd\\u200d\\ud83d\\ude80 my 2008 build apt in atlanta is way nicer than the 2022 built one i had in ny metro. the build quality in new builds here still feels weird but the amenities make up for it. tons of amenity space, hard to find that in nyc without paying obscene amounts. i wish carpet was back in style (yes, i know it's dirty, but that soft feel is amazing, nyc unfortunately never had a carpet phase) and i wish floor to ceiling windows or otherwise giant windows went out of style (i like privacy more than light). totally agreed. people making less than 100k have roommates. the natives stay with parents for a long time. or people live in huge older apartments rented a long time ago from mom and pop landlords but they deal with a bad commute (20 mins bus ride to a train). i\\u2019ve done all these things, and i\\u2019ve also had the luxury studio to myself (in a neighborhood that most transplants wouldn\\u2019t tolerate). i\\u2019m over it and i\\u2019ve decided that it\\u2019s not worth it to be here. yes the new builds are terrible and probably violating building code behind the drywall. also watch out for crazy electric bills in new or refurbished units, with no real reason why. what you\\u2019ve noticed is what gets lost with the \\u201cbuild more housing\\u201d crowd. we are getting shitty builds that get evermore expensive. you just said what everyone who is either from here or has been living here for over 15 years has been thinking and feeling. it's bs. i'm in the midst of moving so i'm viewing apartment after apartment and quite frankly, it's disrespectful. my roommate and i finally found a real nice place off the j/m at myrtle-broadway, it wasn't renovated but it still was nice and had all the space we needed/ wanted... they were asking $5800 !!!!!!!! for a 2 bedroom duplex. with no curb appeal. nyc has gotten out of control. i'm over it. this is my last place. kitchen islands so big that there's no usable space in the living room to put a couch and tv newer construction typically follows a pretty limited set of layouts - very few closets, pullman style kitchen, and ~120 sqft bedrooms. they'll typically spend more effort on hyping up amenities or the appliances or whatever, which cost nothing compared to the real estate and construction. it's a little depressing. i live in comparatively new construction but i managed to avoid most of that. the last part of your comment is the most important. more housing needs to be built in \\\"high opportunity areas.\\\" tell your elected officials. :( ![gif](giphy|ocmgluo7d5jj6) new construction units get smaller n smaller!  if that\\u2019s your preference then deal with the high price n small square footage!  otherwise look for prewar buildings. the cost of construction (and land) in nyc is so high that any new building is going to have rent that\\u2019s commensurate with the building\\u2019s cost. as someone who has lived in manhattan most of my life, and just left a job in real estate after 10 years, no one moves to new york city for the space. the best you should hope for is to have an apartment with nice light. lol my apartment is literally a plus sign as the floor plan and i can only fit my queen bed in my wife and i\\u2019s room. barely a dining table and a couch which we haven\\u2019t purchased a couch yet because i have no idea what size loveseat would fit in our living room/ dining room. rent here is 3,500+ for a two bedroom. i live in the south bronx honestly if you are in a place in your life where you can rent a condo, do it. it\\u2019s not always a great fit with roommates or guarantors or people who struggle with paperwork or need to move right away.   the floor plans are so much better.   also i realize not everyone wants or needs a tenant agent, and this time of year it can be hard to get one, but we can steer you towards places with good layouts.   also being flexible with location helps immensely.  best of luck,  suzanne older buildings are vastly superior to new construction!!!! much more livable and the window units are really not even a con. easy to control how hot/cold you want each room highly recommend looking deep into brooklyn, you\\u2019d be surprised how commutable it is into midtown and below. heavy on the half glass shower it\\u2019s so stupid and the thin walls. that\\u2019s my apartment to a tee. exactly why i stay in my rundown dilapidated building. this is what happens when you effectively ban new construction. all the \\u201cnew housing\\u201d is just put into terrible floorplates. kitchens and living rooms are not included in this playset \\ud83d\\ude2c a lot of new apartments are also really poorly built even when they're expensive/luxury buildings etc the new units are so so so small don't forget, the ceilings are very short. and the heating is electric, so your electric bill is an extra 300 per month. welcome to new york. it\\u2019s been waiting for you. but what gets me is 800,000 people have reportedly left since 2020. how is the vacancy rate 1.4%??? like and before anyone answers migrants apparently the recent wave was around 200,000 but many have been moved to other cities and i\\u2019m not trying to be a bitch, but i have my doubts about migrants being responsible for the housing squeeze considering how harsh nyc landlords are about paperwork and income. as a native nyer, i'm moving to jersey because this shit is rigged. roommates and living further out in crappier neighborhoods. we need a r/nycapartmenetsrant sub i mean, there's a reason why pre-war buildings historically valuate much more highly than stereotypical new construction.  i live in a brownstone and a car ran into it. the car fared much worse. i loved my seven years in manhattan.  on a weekend out in the hamptons during year three, i made my exit plan.  i realized that the quality of life was horrible for the price and, unless i was very, very rich and had a second home someplace else, i would have only sloppy seconds.  the best decision of my life was that exit plan, but moving there was my second-best decision.  pay up and live in the center of it for awhile.   then decide it you want to scramble for sloppy seconds for the rest of your life. it\\u2019s just you. no one has ever noticed or mentioned it before, thanks for speaking up! move to jersey city no, not really my experience. maybe you are going too low dollar? yeah, it\\u2019s evil isn\\u2019t it? welcome to my apartment \\ud83d\\ude02 the only reason we can afford it is because it\\u2019s rent stabilized (thanks housing lottery!). my two bedroom retails for like $3200/month. yep. been there. had a storage unit tried all of them! manhattan mini, local locker, cube smart. cube smart made my clothes smell like cat piss. you are absolutely correct! the developers who are building these new apartments are building what i would say are the smallest spaces i have ever seen. for example, there is a development company that are constructing apartments with bedrooms so small, only a twin size beds could fit in them. moreover, the bathrooms only have showers (no tubs) that are so narrow, one could barely turn around in them. the door also hits the sink in the bathroom. all for the fantastic price of $3000+\\u2019per month! it\\u2019s ridiculous! i think ny is moving away from trying to accommodate families! people making less than 100k get roommates often 3 or more. and as long as people keep reassuring landlords their apartments are amazing and going into droves for their shitty apartments its gonna keep getting smaller and pricier.  meanwhile there's mice, roaches, and black mold going rampant behind the scenes. the funny thing about the word luxury is...if you have to say it in the name, it's not luxury. it's a label for common man, not the wealthy.  things that are luxurious just...are, there is no need to label them, everyone knows it is luxury. when you slap luxury on the label of something, the only thing you can be certain of, is that it is not actually luxurious. if more people would actually believe what a shithole nyc has turned into after pandemic, fewer surprises like this would have happened. the city has lost its charm. predatory landlord and uninhabitable properties are a norm now. the apartment i live in isn\\u2019t tiny, doesn\\u2019t have a weird floor plan, poor build quality, egregious pricing and it\\u2019s not labeled as a \\u201cluxury\\u201d apartment. so to answer your questions no you must be taking crazy pills or you\\u2019re ignoring the dozens of apartment listings that don\\u2019t fit that criteria. don't forget your bathroom will be as big as your bedroom because of mandatory wheelchair accessibility lmao the major brokerages in nyc are sothebys ( where i worked), douglas elliman, brown harris, corcoran, compass. i would call the front desk and ask if any of the agents are good at rentals and/or are new and looking for clients. i can send you names if you like. get rid of the zoning laws and processes in place to make building as difficult as possible.   this country has a weird obsession with \\u201cpreserving the character\\u201d of a neighborhood, or whatever the fuck that means. most of the existing residential buildings in manhattan should have been torn down and rebuilt decades ago. [deleted] sounds like you\\u2019re looking at conversions. new york has a population density of 27,485  people per square mile. compare that with houston at 3,614 or phoenix at 3,105. what do you expect, gigantic apartments for a cheap price? they could build more skyscrapers but the construction costs increase geometrically with the height of the building.  since you new yorkers like to live in top of each other, you've got to pay the price. either live in an apartment the size of a broom closet or pay an exorbitant rent.\",\n          \"personal finance in new york is wild. i have friends who make a lot of money and can technically afford to live in apartments that are expensive, but probably shouldn\\u2019t. my friend who probably makes the most money (and has a rare two story apartment) also has significant credit card debt they don\\u2019t have plans to pay off fully and no real retirement savings. i\\u2019m convinced that most of the city is pretty bad at money in favor of keeping up with the joneses. i can afford $5k as a software engineer  but i will never nyc is a hub for finance jobs (investment banking, private equity) and tech jobs at the big companies (meta and google in particular have large nyc presence).   hence why there's so many people with large budgets. yo forreal there\\u2019s a wide range between affording $3k and affording $5k; per standard reqs, that equates to respective salaries of $120k and $200k   i can \\u201cafford\\u201d $4k, technically speaking, but i actually pay $2k  i do accounting, and i bartend; dollar-for-dollar, i earn about the same per hour at both jobs  yes, we are hiring accountants; no, we are not hiring bartenders work in marketing/ad tech. i can technically afford 4k in rent but choose not to, currently paying 1750 in a rent-stabilized studio. could contemplate up to maybe 2.5-3k to upgrade to a nicer 1 bedroom but that's a big maybe and would have to depend on the apartment! software engineer, big tech. i could afford 5.5k a month based on the 40x rule but that seems outrageous so capped myself at 3.5k  edit: comments locked so can\\u2019t reply but i had 1 yoe when i got my current job. i did however do 5 internships before my last job. attorney and i can barely cover my rent though it\\u2019s possible. software the people that i know who afford such apartments went to top universities, had almost perfect gpas, got the right internships, and now work for big tech companies or hedge funds, private equity, investment banking. or have rich parents.   unfortunately it\\u2019s pretty rare to be able to afford such a place outside those circumstances. tech sales. they are always hiring but you start at the bottom (well worth the easy life) if it's not a tech worker couple, a tech worker from an ivy school, or an institutionalized tech worker, then it's a lawyer, doctor, or finance slave family money and/or international money not worth   you get a better return investing those funds into smart stocks i work in marketing everyone i know who lives in that price range has minimum 2 roommates tech, finance, law, medicine, lots of career paths to $200k+. not a secret, you do well in school and you put in the work.

nyc is one of the most culturally-rich cities in the world. you can find any cuisine in many forms, from street vendor to michelin star restaurant. fantastic music venues, museums, shops, bars, parks, etc. you could pick one part of brooklyn and do everything that is offered in an entire city in america.  i\\u2019m exaggerating a bit, but it\\u2019s mostly true. nyc has plenty of problems like any major city. it\\u2019s expensive, sometimes dirty, untreated mental illness, but, the community and culture is worth it in my opinion. 9 million people do. so my response is typically,  \\\"have you ever been there before?\\\"  and i wait to hear what they have to say.   i've driven around the entire united states, and the one thing i learned is this:   **if you are from nyc, you don't understand how the rest of the country functions. and if you are not from nyc, you have no idea how nyc functions.**   something i can only say after driving around the country in a van, doing touring theatre, hanging out with audience members, and trying to live out of motels. depends on who is saying it and if they are being condescending while expressing their views. they are many parts of living here that are awful, exclusionary, and unsafe that may drive me out of the city in the future despite having built a full life here me: \\\"i agree.\\\"  i just... there are some things to \\\\*like\\\\* about nyc, but there are a lot of things to \\\\*loathe\\\\* about nyc  that's just me. i know a lot of people can live a pretty steady, consistent life in here with very little trouble. i admire and honestly am jealous bye.  the door is to the left.  see you never. i hope you're happy where you land. \\u201cyeah, you couldn\\u2019t\\u201d me too i miss ny a lot! moved to dallas a few months ago and i want to go back haha i can\\u2019t find the same parks here, can\\u2019t find the same quality food at restaurants, everything is better in ny.  it\\u2019s definitely more stinky in some places in ny but that\\u2019s city life, if people don\\u2019t like city life they wouldn\\u2019t like many walking cities honestly. it\\u2019s funny how it js socially acceptable to say \\u201ci could never live in (big city)\\u201d but if you say \\u201ci could never live in (suburban town)\\u201d you\\u2019re being rude. i just nod and agree with them.   a. i want to keep rent down b. i've made my own life out for myself here are the last 5 years and if i wanted people from my rural hometown in my regular life still i would've moved back home. i grew up in iowa so i completely understand as far as cleanliness, environment, physical space, quiet etc. but personally i was bored outta my damn mind there and they really can't comprehend the lifestyle you live out here. ya you\\u2019re right, you couldn\\u2019t i usually say i could never live where they live. okay would you like to list anything else you don\\u2019t do? should i start listing the things i don\\u2019t do? sorry i\\u2019m not so good with weird conversations. why would i care? i can never live in any random suburb but they sure do \\\"i don't know how you can live here.\\\" anyone that has said this to me hasn\\u2019t ever even visited new york good, rent is expensive enough. can you imagine if everyone wanted to live here? \\u201cyeah i don\\u2019t think you could either\\u201d i get it, you don't have the mental fortitude :) new york is devastated by you not being there it takes a certain kind of person to live here. sometimes i wonder whether i am cut out for it. but it is the city that puts all others to shame. i can walk out my door and never hop in a car or even a train and do all of my grocery shopping, go to the gym, sit and read by the waterfront or in a nearby park, decide on dinner at 20 restaurants 300 feet away, and watch the lights flicker on just as the sun sets. i can hear 5 different languages just walking to get breakfast. i have my choice of 10 different coffee shops to do wfh. i can thrift free art and furniture right off the street. maybe there\\u2019s a city or two in europe that could, perhaps, match some of the vibes i get here. but if i were a betting man, my money would always be on the sui generis of cities. \\u201ci know, i can tell\\u201d and look at them smugly. it\\u2019s interesting that this is such a common comment - i would never think to turn to someone who lives in kansas and declare that i could never live how they live. it would be so condescending for me to say that as a new yorker, but somehow the reverse is not\\u2026? maybe because it\\u2019s \\u201cpunching up\\u201d aka the city is so obviously desirable there\\u2019s a reason so many of the world\\u2019s most popular shows and movies take place here and it\\u2019s packed to the gills with people trying to make it here. for this reason i usually shrug it off as little sister behavior. ![gif](giphy|j8fzim9vobu6q) yeah it\\u2019s not for the weak the city weeds out the bitches. \\u201ci could never live in *insert town or suburb where they live*. i don\\u2019t know how people can live there.\\u201d \\u201cnot surprised\\u201d okay would you like to list anything else you don\\u2019t do? should i start listing the things i don\\u2019t do? sorry i\\u2019m not so good with weird conversations. my cousin who lives in a trailer in bumfuck, backwoods usa said he could never live here and i just laughed and replied \\u201coh i agree, this city isn\\u2019t for the weak.\\u201d some people aren\\u2019t built to handle how tough it is either \\u201cyeah, i don\\u2019t think you could either\\u201d or \\u201ci couldn\\u2019t live where you live either\\u201d \\ud83d\\ude02 \\u201c8.3 million people live here so its actually not that hard?\\u201d don\\u2019t. a friend and his wife were flabbergasted when i told them that after a weekend of complaining how much they would never live in nyc while crashing at my place. not with that attitude! yeah you probably couldn\\u2019t. \\\"who says we want you here?\\\" this is a classic republican/trump attitude, so i view it as very political. \\\"i'm sorry your mental weakness is drowning out your statement, please rephrase \\\" \\ud83e\\udd37\\ud83c\\udffb\\u200d\\u2642\\ufe0f you\\u2019re right, you couldn\\u2019t. \\u201cis that not a rude thing to say where you\\u2019re from?\\u201d good thing nobody\\u2019s inviting you. only the strongest survives new york. i'd say, you don't know what you're talking about. fuck you!\\u00a0 or \\\"to each, his own\\\" i say \\u201cgood\\u201d we don\\u2019t want you here. you weren\\u2019t invited then don\\u2019t there\\u2019s only one answer. \\u201cfuggisyoutalmbout?\\u201d you either love it or hate it! it\\u2019s great that you don\\u2019t then :) i tell them nyc has 8 million people so maybe you should stfu and learn something ![gif](giphy|j8fzim9vobu6q) then dont shut up  go sit over there  please go away \\u201cyeah you definitely couldn\\u2019t!\\u201d my mom always says this. great, you\\u2019ve chosen where you want to live and i\\u2019ve chosen where i ant to live. i don\\u2019t spend all my time telling you how much i hate where you live why do you do it to me lol i say. fuck you. you want to but you can\\u2019t it\\u2019s usually some fools stuck in an echo chamber of disinformation showing random photos of fire, broken windows, and wrecked police cars from 2020. but yeah, no place like ny. i travel quite a bit, have had to move all over for work, and i always miss ny in the end. don\\u2019t let the door hit you in the ass! adios!!! you have to be tough to live in new york a friend of mine lived in new york city had a dog named taxi. \\u201cyeah, it\\u2019s not for everybody.\\u201d tell them they probably wouldn\\u2019t be happy here and they should stay where they are. i moved to brooklyn in 2006-straight from college and been here since. could not imagine living anywhere else!!! go fuck yourself! we aren't exactly \\\"living\\\" ![gif](giphy|1msy0o1ma3bslybzua|downsized) ![gif](giphy|ldbuyzawu8l4i|downsized)  \\\"then, don't\\\" the people who say this would so obviously get eaten alive that i\\u2019m not bothered anymore. they can keep thinking that when you live in nyc there\\u2019s someone lurking around every corner to stab you and no one speaks english or whatever fb told them. at least i make more than $7/hour and i have the option to fuck someone who isn\\u2019t my second cousin. that's fine. say don\\u2019t. you have no idea what you\\u2019re missing. i lived here my whole life. and love it \\\"you can't handle it, it's okay.\\\" i agree. [deleted] \\\"i'm here, in one piece and as financially ranked as the rest of us.\\\" same probably you get used to it.  (i'm a transplant) \\ud83d\\udc4d\\ud83c\\udffd \\u201cya know, that reminds me of an old yogi berra saying\\u201d \\\"me neither, can i leave?\\\" good i know ok then. it's not for everyone and honestly a lot of people complain about creature comforts. i always thought of it as look at the city as your extended living room and you've got every opportunity open to you.  it's not some peoples cup of tea and that's perfectly ok.   i mean, i could never live in new jersey. \\ud83d\\ude43 https://preview.redd.it/ay8qe0graiid1.jpeg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=922157c92e472d2f8b90ce9ad6e3c64a1d5380aa  i be like cool i'll enjoy this view regardless. good the rents too damn high already \\ud83e\\udd37\\ud83c\\udffb\\u200d\\u2640\\ufe0f \\u201ci hate driving.\\u201d \\\"lol same. i like the quality of life though. could never live where you do\\\" nyc has the highest high and lowest lows. i love what makes it great way more than disdain what makes it challenging. \\u201cyeah i completely get you, a lot of people i know can\\u2019t afford it too\\u201d cool. i can\\u2019t live in gaithersburg either.  (actual convo with a friend of mine from maryland) i don't know how i live here either. slow blink and stare. my response is basically what others have commented, \\\"ok\\\". but i sometimes think i should have answered, \\\"why does someone living in new york make you feel the need to defend not living in new york?\\\" great, don't. it\\u2019s not for the weak \\u201cfacts. idk how i live here\\u201d \\u201cthat\\u2019s because your a lil bitch\\u201d we're full anyways \\ud83e\\udd23 well...i don't know how anyone can live here. note: where ever they live. go kick rocks! but also ok good! we don\\u2019t want no more transplants lol i mean i\\u2019ve lived here for 10 years and own a house in brooklyn and i still kind of feel like i can\\u2019t live here the first thing to remember when someone says this is it has nothing to do with you. they are just stating their preference (even if not worded well). so just don't take it personally.  everyone has preferences. usually i say something like \\\"i hear you\\\" which validates / witnesses their point of view without giving up mine. aaaaaannnnnnndddddd? i\\u2019ve always believed myself a better human for having lived there. ight ok boomer it is helpful to know why they say that. if it\\u2019s money, it\\u2019s rhetorical. but sometimes it\\u2019s bc it seems overwhelming, too big, too anonymous\\u2014to which i say, but each neighborhood is a small enclave. you get to know your local small grocer on the corner, your mail person, etc. and then when you walk further out, there\\u2019s the vital energy. you start to know which streets to walk, for when you want low-key energy and a direct passage. then another day, you want the variety and the hustle and bustle. i always feel seen in ny, and i equally *see* so many people. a main reason why i love it. give me your wallet! yeah rats are an acquired taste \\u201ci could visit the m&m store but i couldn\\u2019t live in the m&m store\\u201d cool lol but also same because it\\u2019s so unreal here lol when i'm feeling spicy: \\\"yeah, you gotta be tough and smart. not everyone can handle it. nothing wrong with that.\\\"   the last part being said in a tone of voice that insinuates there is, in fact, something wrong with that. *shrugs* \\u201cso don\\u2019t\\u201d get the f out in god speed there is a great new song by morgan st jean - \\u201cme this time.\\u201d  choosing nyc over a relationship.  i would play it for them mofo leave lol new york is always two decades ahead...imo \\u201cnyc is more than just time square and midtown.\\u201d \\\"i understand\\\" \\\"i agree\\\" the patrice o'neal head tilt/shoulder shrug but with the absolute minimum effort possible. of course you couldn't, dear (smiles sympathetically) i send them this video  https://youtu.be/tnpoplflt1w?si=gkripvvihmx4a0hr stay where you\\u2019re comfortable. i\\u2019m going to explore and discover myself. tell them to enjoy olive garden and everything closing at 8pm, we dont miss you it\\u2019s not for everyone i would never live in the suburbs of [atlanta / dallas / charlotte] k cool okay \\u201csame\\u201d there are more than a million people who disagree more for me ppl are always going to have something to say that could rub you the wrong way. it\\u2019s annoying but i\\u2019ve learned to just not engage. shrug your shoulders, nod, and move on to the next topic. \\u201cso anyway\\u2026\\u201d ppl aren\\u2019t going to change their opinions and you\\u2019re better off letting it go than letting it aggravate you.  don\\u2019t waste your time or energy! just my 2 cents! \\\"that's fair.\\\" because they probably have a point of two that is legitimate and probably not being confrontational perse. everyone has their preferences. why they decided to blurt that out loud depends on the situation i guess. why make care payments or car insurance payments or gasoline payments when everything is a block away folks in my hometown often say that but i think they mean it as a compliment, rather than an insult.   as i interpret it, they found the hustle and bustle of new york intimidating when they visited, so they are \\u201cin awe\\u201d (heavy air quotes there - i\\u2019m not so narcissistic i think they\\u2019re actually awed by me) of my ability to handle the grit, the trains, the noise, the directness, etc.   i tend to respond, \\u201coh i love it, it\\u2019s been a great fit for me.\\u201d keeps my pride intact without being dismissive. good. \\u201cyeop, only some people can take it.\\u201d being this poor must suck a lot of people won't admit what they don't know.\\u00a0 good for them for admitting it. good thing it\\u2019s me and not you \\u201cgood thing you don\\u2019t\\u201d \\u201ci don\\u2019t know how i could live here myself, still trying to figure that out\\u201d laughter i get it. this place kinda sucks. i mean i can totally see why someone wouldn\\u2019t want to live here. it\\u2019s not for everyone and as someone who\\u2019s lived here most of my life it does get frustrating sometimes. i moved from a quiet neighborhood in the midwest to new york and my response is \\u201ceh, ya get used to it after a bit\\u201d \\u201cyeah i get it. that\\u2019s how i feel about the suburbs\\u201d i tell them \\u201cthat\\u2019s great, bc i could never live where you live either.\\u201d and just look at their face, waiting for the irony to hit. \\u201cwell millions of people do so it must work somehow!\\u201d same! want to grab a coffee at park and 125th? i tell them i can't wait to get out too. then don\\u2019t - we have enough people already\\ud83d\\ude00 \\u201cprobably for the best. you\\u2019re not strong enough to handle it anyway\\u201d \\\"that was always allowed\\\" my husband agrees with them and says \\u201cyeah, you wouldn\\u2019t make it here.\\u201d \\u201cyeah, i totally hear you\\u201d  lifelong manhattanite going on 53, i get why people say that. it\\u2019s such a specific lifestyle. \\u201cyea, it\\u2019s not for everyone\\u201d that\\u2019s why the city is so empty! \\u201cnot everyone can live here\\u201d lmao \\u201cthe struggle is real.\\u201d this tickled me. just moved back to manhattan with my husband and four year old after a decade in the burbs. i don't know why everyone is so offended by this question. there's lots of places i wouldn't live either and would say the exact same thing about. that\\u2019s ok, it\\u2019s just not for you, don\\u2019t blame yourself. yeah, it\\u2019s not for everyone we don\\u2019t want you. nothing. i don\\u2019t care. \\u201cyeah, ny would probably eat you alive. it\\u2019s not for everyone.\\u201d \\u201ci don\\u2019t know how i live here either.\\u201d \\\"i dont blame you, it sucks\\\" the irony of wanting to live in nyc when i was broke vs being able to afford it now and not wanting to \\ud83d\\ude02 it\\u2019s funny how people say stuff like that not even knowing how nyc is or have never been there\\u2026. i agree i tell them - please go - makes more room for the people who truly want to be here. i tell them there is a waiting list for almost all apts. in ny and if there isn't then there is something wrong with the apt.   i tell people that the trick in life is to find a place where you like to live  - and then live there. \\u201cgood. new york is pretty full.\\u201d \\u201cit aint for everybody\\u201d + \\ud83e\\udd37\\ud83c\\udffd\\u200d\\u2640\\ufe0f then it\\u2019s a good thing you don\\u2019t! my response is i don\\u2019t blame you that\\u2019s a feature, not a bug there's a reason it's in every type of media to each their own. it\\u2019s def not for everyone. some people like space and peace and quiet. others want to live in the middle of all the action.  it\\u2019s a weird trend where everyone has to attack or defend where they live. if you like it there who gives af lol my wife and i moved back in february after 14 very pleasant years in the charleston suburbs. liked it well enough there, but always felt like this was home, could never really lean hard into life there. my standard response is \\\"it's not for everybody.\\\" there are plenty of things that suck about living here, i'm not totally sure this was the right call for us in our middle age years, but..like everywhere else would feel like i was on the outside looking in. literally 10-20 million people exist here just fine. most of the entire globe lives in places like nyc \\ud83e\\udd37\\ud83c\\udffe\\u200d\\u2640\\ufe0f then don\\u2019t i don\\u2019t know how i live here either well it depends where. i live eastern long island and it's expensive but so beautiful i wouldn't want to live anywhere else did i ask you? \\\"sir, this is a wendy's\\\" that\\u2019s right. you couldn\\u2019t. so many people scared of nyc for little reason. imo only drawback is cost of living. \\u201coh yeah, not everyone\\u2019s mentally strong enough to live in the city. good for you for knowing that about yourself.\\u201d non-condescending: \\u201ck\\u201d. condescending: \\u201cnot everyone can handle it\\u201d.  ultra-condescending: \\u201cactually, i really love it here. i\\u2019m so happy.\\u201d \\u201cthat\\u2019s how i feel about *insert their town*\\u201d i live in ny and as soon as i complete my latest project i am out of here and away from houckle. i agree with them. \\u201cokay lol i agree ig\\u201d native nyer here, i get it. nyc is like david lynch movies, i think they are beautiful, fascinating, and often disturbing masterpieces, but i totally get that some people just wouldn\\u2019t like them at all or find them appealing in any way. \\u201cwe built different\\u201d \\\"yeah only certain kind of people can live here. it has its own way of weeding out the weak\\\" \\u201csame, and i\\u2019ve lived there 24 years\\u201d well stay where you are then. don\\u2019t worry bout it sweetheart. you don't have to respond. let people live in their little world. i agree im not asking for a roomate, uncle mark \\u201ci didn\\u2019t ask\\u201d or \\u201cyeah, a lot of people can\\u2019t hack it!\\u201d mind ya business \\\"okay leave\\\" i know this place is a shit hole \\u201ci get that\\u201d \\u201cyou\\u2019re right, you definitely couldn\\u2019t handle it here\\u201d i say i understand. i only came here for the art as an artist but that whole crowd is snooty political and male dominated and disgusting so about to leave after 20 years. sick of the abuse and anger, commutes. i feel like the art meca will not be here. a more annoying question is, how do you live there, homeless, dangerous, and so small good literally nothing because i don\\u2019t care. just smile. i will tell him straight to his face - \\u201cyou.. you.. you are totally right and the city became garbage\\u201d don\\u2019t come \\\"yeah, i can tell.\\\" whenever tourists at my job say this i just respond with \\u201cwow. devastating.\\u201d provincial snowflakes, they scared of chocolate colored people good! it's too crowded as it is. good to know your limits i grew up in la and have lived in new york for almost 20 years. i fairly often have a dodgers or lakers hat on and new yorkers fairly often tell me how much they hate la.   i\\u2019ve found that responding with \\u201cif i wanted your opinion i would have asked you\\u201d works pretty well.   same thing works here. you don\\u2019t have to make it about where they live, you just have to remind them that just because they have an opinion doesn\\u2019t mean they need to share it. \\\"cause i work here\\\" is usually my response. lol let me guess, it\\u2019s too expensive. \\u201ci love it, you don\\u2019t have to. it\\u2019s not for everyone.\\u201d i don\\u2019t engage with people like this. it's okay. we don't want you here anyway. ngl i mostly live here because i work here and don't want to commute. my coworkers from li have asked me how i live here, i just ask them what time they had to wake up to get to work and what time they will get home. for them it's 4:10am then they get home around 5:30. i get up at 6:10 and am usually home before 3pm. on the weekends they are usually sleeping in to catch up on sleep, while i'm still waking up at 6:10 feeling refreshed, then head to the beach or mountains. please don\\u2019t then. we have enough problems. go and live somewhere where you\\u2019re happy and spare us your ignorant opinions \\\"i didn't choose to be born here.\\\" is what i've told people. because i didn't lol. is this new york the state or new york city. i love my small town in upstate new york. \\ud83c\\udfb6 \\ud83c\\udfb5 where everybody know your name...\\ud83c\\udfb6 suck my dick nod/smile/walk away \\u201cnobody cares\\u201d good we got enough people from the middle of nowhere making tik tok videos here \\u201cyeah, not everyone has what it takes to succeed here socially or economically\\u201d *silence* different strokes for different folks. no need to stoop to something haughty. the same as anywhere else they go to work eat poop reproduce and so on it\\u2019s a really great is what i say. but what i think is if you have to ask why nyc you do not only not belong there but you will never get it. this kind of comment is likely not a personal value judgement. nyc is an objectively difficult place to eke out an existence. there are many reasons why someone would say they can\\u2019t or don\\u2019t want to live here that are in no way derogatory. l + ratio + didn\\u2019t ask good. we are full it does completely suck right now, would leave if i could it's a hard city, but you're never bored. everyday feels like a movie good, there's too many people already. we have a housing shortage. i\\u2019m sorry there\\u2019s no more room. it's pretty much how everyone used to live unless you were a farmer. i feel bad for them. \\\"i didn't ask\\\" nyc isn\\u2019t for the weak so i understand only the strong survive i simply say \\\"i like it,\\\" but i'm thinking [this](https://youtube.com/clip/ugkxb82j_rahxxae3wboxd9robiivk7f_0r2?si=hgwt5vjwoa826fqx). ![gif](giphy|7k2loeyky5i1hfewqb) them:\\\"i could nev-\\\" me: \\\"hard agree\\\" a lot of bitter & sassy answers in this thread. it\\u2019s not a personal attack if someone doesn\\u2019t want to live here. i moved out of that toilet a long time ago wouldn\\u2019t go back for all the money in the world. good. \\u201ccan i get a #3 with a large soda?\\u201d i usually respond with curiosity. oh, what makes you say that? then if they offer a negative assumption that isn\\u2019t true (it\\u2019s too dangerous, etc) i say, oh that hasn\\u2019t been my experience and then they usually stop.  sometimes i\\u2019ll say oh yea i get it- i could never live in the rural midwest, we all have our preferences and that also usually stops them   honestly it\\u2019s fine if both everyone wants to live here but usually when people say that it\\u2019s with a critical edge so i try to shut it down then i guess you shouldn\\u2019t. honestly man\\u2026 i don\\u2019t know how i can even live here anymore.  it\\u2019s gotten exponentially harder to find a fucking apartment since the last time i moved.  i\\u2019ve been couch surfing and subletting since april and i\\u2019m completely over it. i have family who are native new yorkers and i\\u2019m an

with them this place is a dump. good. good. don\\u2019t come here, we have enough real new yorkers already living here. that i hate it to and feel stuck here to the people who have asked me that, my response was   \\\"don't believe everything you see in movies or on the news. yes its true we have crime and our mayor sucks but there is more to ny than the 5 boroughs. alot of people live in very beautiful areas that are safe and only commute to manhattan for work\\\" i tell them we're glad not to have them. i agree: you couldn\\u2019t as someone from nyc i\\u2019d say i agree \\ud83e\\udd23 \\u201cyes, as a new yorker i can say it is pretty bad. stay out\\u201d. this way, hopefully, we can bring the rent down and enjoy our city with those who love it, like i do. to each their own

much better to take care of its constituents. i shrug and say it\\u2019s actually better when you live there. visiting can be stressful, but when you have home to get back to and you generally know your way around, it\\u2019s a great place to live. \\u201ci agree. it\\u2019s unlikely you would be able to make it out here.\\u201d not sure that requires any response. \\\"time is a construct and capitalism is killing us all, i don't know how people live anywhere.\\\" so don\\u2019t live here you\\u2019re so right! i have a couple of cousins who always make remarks about me living in nyc. i just tell them, \\\"it's not for the weak\\\" fuck off. i say i love the energy. it is the capital of the universe. the news o it reports on the crime. very safe. good, leave \\u201cyeah you\\u2019re right. you probably couldn\\u2019t \\u201c it\\u2019s not for everyone.   most nyers could never live in really rural areas; same concept. you don\\u2019t need a response. i just say it\\u2019s not for everybody.i remember a friend told me i need to move out of new york and how bad it is blah blah blah all because she moved to pennsylvania,so i told her it\\u2019s not that easy for me to move

don\\u2019t.\\u201d no need to take offense when people say that. a lot of people don't like the loud city environment and high rent. if you live in ny, you know it's not perfect. my sister says that to me all the time. most of the times, i just smile and change the topic.  but few times i have responded \\u201c i can't live at a place where i have to drive everywhere.  every ones

fine.\\u201d  i totally get it. it isn\\u2019t for everyone and that is okay. i love it. sometimes it feels like an abusive relationship, but it is hard to imagine living anywhere else unless it is

most of east coast, great jobs? i can totally see why people live there, i just don't understand how you afford to good! it's already too crowded. *internally thinks to self* \\u201cidk how i live here either\\u201d i just say imagine california. \\ud83d\\ude02 \\u201cand that\\u2019s why you don\\u2019t\\u201d truuue i get don\\u2019t get why so many so called new yorkers here in the comments can\\u2019t imagine how life in nyc is objectively harder than if we lived anywhere else. like if someone said this to me i\\u2019d be like \\u201ci know! rent is crazy in nyc\\u201d   like it\\u2019s not a personal attack, it\\u2019s just true. it\\u2019s crazy dense, the rent is unbelievable the taxes wild, the proximity and density of humans per block is 5-10x any other us city.   for better or for worse yes we\\u2019re all here for a reason, but don\\u2019t pretend your quality of life would not improve if you left. it\\u2019s not always a put down if someone says they could never live here. it\\u2019s a lot! well it\\u2019s good you dont \\u201cit\\u2019s definitely not for the weak\\u201d yeah, but are the rats in oklahoma living like kings? didn\\u2019t think so. \\u201ci know, it\\u2019s a horrible city but it\\u2019s where my job is.\\u201d i would live in ny if i had the money to do it in style. think terrace instead of balcony. great. don\\u2019t. i lived in new york and i wish i listened to the people who told me this. the city is a shit-ridden scum factory. people weren't meant to live like that. i rightfully judge people who genuinely enjoy it. me neither then don\\u2019t. then don\\u2019t move here fine. there\\u2019s enough of us here already. shit ain\\u2019t easy out here my boy!!!!!! i sometimes think i wouldn't want to if i weren't a native.  but only every other day. just means i'm stronger than you why is this such a common thing for people to say?! i\\u2019ve had multiple people say that to me and i\\u2019m always so confused. i wouldn\\u2019t say that about where they live. depends but sometimes just a \\u201cthat\\u2019s awesome, glad you know that! i dont know how you could live here either. :)\\u201d to each their own. it\\u2019s not for the weak. the city doesn't need anymore transplants trying to live their best \\\"friends,\\\" \\\"sex and the city,\\\" or \\\"broad city\\\" lifestyle, so it's okay!\\ud83d\\udc4c\\ud83c\\udffe same. it\\u2019s an over expensive pile of litter and smells like garbage. cool museums and parks though and fun for day trips! you\\u2019re right; you couldn\\u2019t \\\"it's not for the weak\\\" are the majority of the people answering this question  transplants? how many people are talking to people that don't live here? most of friends and family are from here. how often are you guys getting asked this question? and by whom? \\u201ci respect your opinion.\\u201d i agree my response is always \\u201cyeah it sucks.\\u201d because it does. i\\u2019m convinced most of you have a fantasy image of what this city is based on movies and tv that clouds your perception of reality.\",\n          \"this has been happening for years but its reach is even wider today. nyc for the less wealthy are offered \\u201cglorified dorms.\\u201d the use the cheapest material, most confusing layouts and tiniest of rooms, but oh! there\\u2019s a pet spa on the roof \\ud83d\\ude44 you must be new here. and you left out one important thing...closets!!! people need closets. anything that doesn't fit in your closets has to be in your living space. i've seen some new apartments in brooklyn, overpriced but doable for me, but tiny closets. so frustrating \\ud83d\\ude24 looking now. good income/credit but a dismal experience. i went to an open house in the ev today, and 50 people showed up. a 150 sf apt; the studio room was so small the frig was squeezed between the (full/double) bed and the wall. 2200. wtf. i applied for a place slightly bigger, les, not great at all; it's been a week since they haven't answered my app. they asked for more financial information, which i gave them. they are obviously going from the richest applicant on down. i'm in a nice airbnb, a beautiful place, and same price as a regular apt but deep bk....ugh damn bro. you didn\\u2019t have to call out my living situation like that lmao i looked at an apartment once. it was gorgeous and was being subletted by the owner (which was a turn off to me anyway because i didn\\u2019t want to deal with that). and there was no refrigerator. actually there were two \\u201cmini fridges\\u201d the type i had in my dorm in college. how does one function without a fridge? for 3,000 a month?! insane you are correct on all of the above. i am moving into a much older apartment next month. you forgot about the lack of kitchens in these new buildings. i have yet to see a new apartment with a proper kitchen. it's always just kitchen stuff along one wall in the living room. what's next? a toilet in the corner of the bedroom? yes. >*it's like the developers tried to squeeze in just one too many units per floor which ended up making the square footage of all the units on the floor borderline unlivable.*  correct. i think one of the issues is that a large part of the market for these apartments are young people with roommates and who don't really care too much about long-term quality-of-life, or life inside their home when nyc is out there waiting for them, or having a reasonable budget that will allow them to live long-term (whether they're kind of yoloing on their own salary or have family assistance to pay the rent).  >*legitimately, how the fuck does anyone making less than 100k per year survive in this city?*  they probably do not live in new builds. lots of people will live in multiple-income households one way or another. and they hunt for deals and pounce on them immediately. and of course, dual or more incomes help a lot compared to a single income.  my first and longest-occupied apartment in nyc was a large one-bedroom in a rent-stabilized 1920's pre-war elevator tenement building in brooklyn. it usually didn't have cockroaches or mice, and it was pretty large, good light, on the top floor, and in reasonable condition, so i loved it. however, it was pretty crappy by anywhere-else standards. plus they're hard to get into. i got very lucky.  my wife and i live in a less-than-20-year-old condo-style building now, and it's nice and affordable for our income today, but it was a very, very lucky find. the broker half-joked that she loved showing this apartment because it was actually adult-sized.  most of our friends are pretty reasonably paid professionals, lots of couples, and my wife and i are the closest to living in a \\\"luxury\\\" new build of anyone at this point. friends live in older tenement-style buildings or partial brownstones.  the older the stock gets, the more it tends to be adult-livable and was better constructed. a lot of this is survivorship bias as much as anything... anything built to very low standards a hundred years ago was probably knocked down fifty years ago.  >*hopefully this city gets it together and eventually starts building way more apartments (with actually livable floor plans).*  yeah, i hope so. in the meantime dig around in queens and brooklyn for something older. make a list of your must-haves and dealbreakers and focus on things other people hate that you don't mind.  when my wife and i started dating she had a nice deal on a one-bedroom by herself because it was on the sixth floor of a non-elevator building. i had a goth friend who lived in manhattan long ago and really liked living in a dark cave, so she got a good deal on a low-floor courtyard apartment. given the timeframe, they were both making around today's equivalent of $80k taking inflation into account.  was still tough for both of them given the pay at the time, but they made it work living alone.  when i first moved here, the broker showed me a similar dark-cave ground-floor interior apartment for like 2/3 the price of the one i eventually lived in. but that was a dealbreaker for me.  if you make significantly less than $80k in today's dollars, and are just moving to nyc, i think many people are looking at roommates/housemates, family (living with them or getting help from), or incredible luck.  my first building was full of retirees and working people who could afford their rent-stabilized places partially because they'd been there a long, long time. i think my next-door neighbor had lived there for 45 years and raised her kids there. she was a retired emergency-room nurse.  rent stabilization/control is a good thing imo, for long-term life, but yeah, we also need significant up-market construction of good quality housing to take the pressure off for people who want to move here now. this is why you always want to find an apt in a pre war building. solid walls and larger rooms. saw a $1 million condo in queens a few years ago that was new construction and same thing. not even a deeded parking spot for that price and no parking near the building i\\u2019ve been living in new builds / luxury apts for 5 years and i\\u2019m so so excited to move to a pre war. there so much bs to deal with in a big luxury building including an incompetent management plus everything you mentioned.   the only luxury buildings that seem worth in are in bk or manhattan and even then there\\u2019s only certain buildings that are really good\\u2014 and studios in those buildings are at least 3.8k so here we are. honestly, i prefer prewar buildings. high ceilings and large bedrooms all the way. on top of it, they all lie about their square footage on the listings lmao welcome to late stage capitalism first time? roommate if you don\\u2019t make atleast 150k.  manhattan is a terrible place to live unless you\\u2019re making bank. go live outside of manhattan.  three types of ppl that lives in manhattan: 1) high earners 2) out of state folks that watches sex and the city  3) government housing folks. look for older buildings, over 100 yrs, in queens, bronx or brooklyn for large size rooms and apartments. the only way to afford it nowadays is to split rent with a partner (or roommate) and live 1-2 hours' commuting distance to manhattan.  my partner and i had a decent place in nj for a year, but the commute through port authority took years off my life, so we ultimately ended up in rockaway park, which is nice because it's at the beach, but it's like 1.5 hour from anywhere.  we rent the second floor of a single-family home from our landlord who lives below us.  we only got a good deal for this reason--we went through craiglist instead of an agency.  no fees or bullshit, and he never raises the rent.  unless you can get lucky with a private landlord, it's hell. this isn't just nyc. it's all new developer led construction in the country. look at places queens /brooklyn. not cheap but you get more space for your money. everyone wants to live in manhattan and there\\u2019s only so much space. as a liver in one of those weird apartments (housing connect so worth) if you can add door shelves and organization stuff from wayfair etc to the closet, it can become the dresser for you. makes no difference functionally (might be easier to find things too) and not having to place a big dresser helps the rest of the apartment layout fall in place. landed yesterday? 150sf?  for the whole place? that's 12'x 12' . my kid has a 600sf  in sutton place at that price point always has been \\ud83c\\udf0e\\ud83e\\uddd1\\u200d\\ud83d\\ude80 \\ud83d\\udd2b\\ud83d\\udc68\\ud83c\\udffd\\u200d\\ud83d\\ude80 my 2008 build apt in atlanta is way nicer than the 2022 built one i had in ny metro. the build quality in new builds here still feels weird but the amenities make up for it. tons of amenity space, hard to find that in nyc without paying obscene amounts. i wish carpet was back in style (yes, i know it's dirty, but that soft feel is amazing, nyc unfortunately never had a carpet phase) and i wish floor to ceiling windows or otherwise giant windows went out of style (i like privacy more than light). totally agreed. people making less than 100k have roommates. the natives stay with parents for a long time. or people live in huge older apartments rented a long time ago from mom and pop landlords but they deal with a bad commute (20 mins bus ride to a train). i\\u2019ve done all these things, and i\\u2019ve also had the luxury studio to myself (in a neighborhood that most transplants wouldn\\u2019t tolerate). i\\u2019m over it and i\\u2019ve decided that it\\u2019s not worth it to be here. yes the new builds are terrible and probably violating building code behind the drywall. also watch out for crazy electric bills in new or refurbished units, with no real reason why. what you\\u2019ve noticed is what gets lost with the \\u201cbuild more housing\\u201d crowd. we are getting shitty builds that get evermore expensive. you just said what everyone who is either from here or has been living here for over 15 years has been thinking and feeling. it's bs. i'm in the midst of moving so i'm viewing apartment after apartment and quite frankly, it's disrespectful. my roommate and i finally found a real nice place off the j/m at myrtle-broadway, it wasn't renovated but it still was nice and had all the space we needed/ wanted... they were asking $5800 !!!!!!!! for a 2 bedroom duplex. with no curb appeal. nyc has gotten out of control. i'm over it. this is my last place. kitchen islands so big that there's no usable space in the living room to put a couch and tv newer construction typically follows a pretty limited set of layouts - very few closets, pullman style kitchen, and ~120 sqft bedrooms. they'll typically spend more effort on hyping up amenities or the appliances or whatever, which cost nothing compared to the real estate and construction. it's a little depressing. i live in comparatively new construction but i managed to avoid most of that. the last part of your comment is the most important. more housing needs to be built in \\\"high opportunity areas.\\\" tell your elected officials. :( ![gif](giphy|ocmgluo7d5jj6) new construction units get smaller n smaller!  if that\\u2019s your preference then deal with the high price n small square footage!  otherwise look for prewar buildings. the cost of construction (and land) in nyc is so high that any new building is going to have rent that\\u2019s commensurate with the building\\u2019s cost. as someone who has lived in manhattan most of my life, and just left a job in real estate after 10 years, no one moves to new york city for the space. the best you should hope for is to have an apartment with nice light. lol my apartment is literally a plus sign as the floor plan and i can only fit my queen bed in my wife and i\\u2019s room. barely a dining table and a couch which we haven\\u2019t purchased a couch yet because i have no idea what size loveseat would fit in our living room/ dining room. rent here is 3,500+ for a two bedroom. i live in the south bronx honestly if you are in a place in your life where you can rent a condo, do it. it\\u2019s not always a great fit with roommates or guarantors or people who struggle with paperwork or need to move right away.   the floor plans are so much better.   also i realize not everyone wants or needs a tenant agent, and this time of year it can be hard to get one, but we can steer you towards places with good layouts.   also being flexible with location helps immensely.  best of luck,  suzanne older buildings are vastly superior to new construction!!!! much more livable and the window units are really not even a con. easy to control how hot/cold you want each room highly recommend looking deep into brooklyn, you\\u2019d be surprised how commutable it is into midtown and below. heavy on the half glass shower it\\u2019s so stupid and the thin walls. that\\u2019s my apartment to a tee. exactly why i stay in my rundown dilapidated building. this is what happens when you effectively ban new construction. all the \\u201cnew housing\\u201d is just put into terrible floorplates. kitchens and living rooms are not included in this playset \\ud83d\\ude2c a lot of new apartments are also really poorly built even when they're expensive/luxury buildings etc the new units are so so so small don't forget, the ceilings are very short. and the heating is electric, so your electric bill is an extra 300 per month. welcome to new york. it\\u2019s been waiting for you. but what gets me is 800,000 people have reportedly left since 2020. how is the vacancy rate 1.4%??? like and before anyone answers migrants apparently the recent wave was around 200,000 but many have been moved to other cities and i\\u2019m not trying to be a bitch, but i have my doubts about migrants being responsible for the housing squeeze considering how harsh nyc landlords are about paperwork and income. as a native nyer, i'm moving to jersey because this shit is rigged. roommates and living further out in crappier neighborhoods. we need a r/nycapartmenetsrant sub i mean, there's a reason why pre-war buildings historically valuate much more highly than stereotypical new construction.  i live in a brownstone and a car ran into it. the car fared much worse. i loved my seven years in manhattan.  on a weekend out in the hamptons during year three, i made my exit plan.  i realized that the quality of life was horrible for the price and, unless i was very, very rich and had a second home someplace else, i would have only sloppy seconds.  the best decision of my life was that exit plan, but moving there was my second-best decision.  pay up and live in the center of it for awhile.   then decide it you want to scramble for sloppy seconds for the rest of your life. it\\u2019s just you. no one has ever noticed or mentioned it before, thanks for speaking up! move to jersey city no, not really my experience. maybe you are going too low dollar? yeah, it\\u2019s evil isn\\u2019t it? welcome to my apartment \\ud83d\\ude02 the only reason we can afford it is because it\\u2019s rent stabilized (thanks housing lottery!). my two bedroom retails for like $3200/month. yep. been there. had a storage unit tried all of them! manhattan mini, local locker, cube smart. cube smart made my clothes smell like cat piss. you are absolutely correct! the developers who are building these new apartments are building what i would say are the smallest spaces i have ever seen. for example, there is a development company that are constructing apartments with bedrooms so small, only a twin size beds could fit in them. moreover, the bathrooms only have showers (no tubs) that are so narrow, one could barely turn around in them. the door also hits the sink in the bathroom. all for the fantastic price of $3000+\\u2019per month! it\\u2019s ridiculous! i think ny is moving away from trying to accommodate families! people making less than 100k get roommates often 3 or more. and as long as people keep reassuring landlords their apartments are amazing and going into droves for their shitty apartments its gonna keep getting smaller and pricier.  meanwhile there's mice, roaches, and black mold going rampant behind the scenes. the funny thing about the word luxury is...if you have to say it in the name, it's not luxury. it's a label for common man, not the wealthy.  things that are luxurious just...are, there is no need to label them, everyone knows it is luxury. when you slap luxury on the label of something, the only thing you can be certain of, is that it is not actually luxurious. if more people would actually believe what a shithole nyc has turned into after pandemic, fewer surprises like this would have happened. the city has lost its charm. predatory landlord and uninhabitable properties are a norm now. the apartment i live in isn\\u2019t tiny, doesn\\u2019t have a weird floor plan, poor build quality, egregious pricing and it\\u2019s not labeled as a \\u201cluxury\\u201d apartment. so to answer your questions no you must be taking crazy pills or you\\u2019re ignoring the dozens of apartment listings that don\\u2019t fit that criteria. don't forget your bathroom will be as big as your bedroom because of mandatory wheelchair accessibility lmao the major brokerages in nyc are sothebys ( where i worked), douglas elliman, brown harris, corcoran, compass. i would call the front desk and ask if any of the agents are good at rentals and/or are new and looking for clients. i can send you names if you like. get rid of the zoning laws and processes in place to make building as difficult as possible.   this country has a weird obsession with \\u201cpreserving the character\\u201d of a neighborhood, or whatever the fuck that means. most of the existing residential buildings in manhattan should have been torn down and rebuilt decades ago. [deleted] sounds like you\\u2019re looking at conversions. new york has a population density of 27,485  people per square mile. compare that with houston at 3,614 or phoenix at 3,105. what do you expect, gigantic apartments for a cheap price? they could build more skyscrapers but the construction costs increase geometrically with the height of the building.  since you new yorkers like to live in top of each other, you've got to pay the price. either live in an apartment the size of a broom closet or pay an exorbitant rent.\",\n          \"personal finance in new york is wild. i have friends who make a lot of money and can technically afford to live in apartments that are expensive, but probably shouldn\\u2019t. my friend who probably makes the most money (and has a rare two story apartment) also has significant credit card debt they don\\u2019t have plans to pay off fully and no real retirement savings. i\\u2019m convinced that most of the city is pretty bad at money in favor of keeping up with the joneses. i can afford $5k as a software engineer  but i will never nyc is a hub for finance jobs (investment banking, private equity) and tech jobs at the big companies (meta and google in particular have large nyc presence).   hence why there's so many people with large budgets. yo forreal there\\u2019s a wide range between affording $3k and affording $5k; per standard reqs, that equates to respective salaries of $120k and $200k   i can \\u201cafford\\u201d $4k, technically speaking, but i actually pay $2k  i do accounting, and i bartend; dollar-for-dollar, i earn about the same per hour at both jobs  yes, we are hiring accountants; no, we are not hiring bartenders work in marketing/ad tech. i can technically afford 4k in rent but choose not to, currently paying 1750 in a rent-stabilized studio. could contemplate up to maybe 2.5-3k to upgrade to a nicer 1 bedroom but that's a big maybe and would have to depend on the apartment! software engineer, big tech. i could afford 5.5k a month based on the 40x rule but that seems outrageous so capped myself at 3.5k  edit: comments locked so can\\u2019t reply but i had 1 yoe when i got my current job. i did however do 5 internships before my last job. attorney and i can barely cover my rent though it\\u2019s possible. software the people that i know who afford such apartments went to top universities, had almost perfect gpas, got the right internships, and now work for big tech companies or hedge funds, private equity, investment banking. or have rich parents.   unfortunately it\\u2019s pretty rare to be able to afford such a place outside those circumstances. tech sales. they are always hiring but you start at the bottom (well worth the easy life) if it's not a tech worker couple, a tech worker from an ivy school, or an institutionalized tech worker, then it's a lawyer, doctor, or finance slave family money and/or international money not worth   you get a better return investing those funds into smart stocks i work in marketing everyone i know who lives in that price range has minimum 2 roommates tech, finance, law, medicine, lots of career paths to $200k+. not a secret, you do well in school and you put in the work. [deleted] finance.  honestly the biggest problem is childcare.  my rent is $5300, and my childcare costs are even more.  barely saving $100k a year since we\\u2019ve had kids. not the point of this sub...\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 227,\n        \"min\": 80,\n        \"max\": 1622,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 154,\n        \"samples\": [\n          515,\n          169,\n          84\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"num_comments\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 114,\n        \"min\": 5,\n        \"max\": 612,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 131,\n        \"samples\": [\n          38,\n          123,\n          52\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"positive\",\n          \"negative\",\n          \"neutral\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment_prob\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.1677352917183019,\n        \"min\": 0.3868812620639801,\n        \"max\": 0.9873421788215636,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 200,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.420522004365921,\n          0.5986307859420776,\n          0.50665283203125\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"engagement\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 287,\n        \"min\": 90,\n        \"max\": 1911,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 171,\n        \"samples\": [\n          211,\n          326,\n          347\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

nyc is one of the most culturally-rich cities in the world. you can find any cuisine in many forms, from street vendor to michelin star restaurant. fantastic music venues, museums, shops, bars, parks, etc. you could pick one part of brooklyn and do everything that is offered in an entire city in america.  i\\u2019m exaggerating a bit, but it\\u2019s mostly true. nyc has plenty of problems like any major city. it\\u2019s expensive, sometimes dirty, untreated mental illness, but, the community and culture is worth it in my opinion. 9 million people do. so my response is typically,  \\\"have you ever been there before?\\\"  and i wait to hear what they have to say.   i've driven around the entire united states, and the one thing i learned is this:   **if you are from nyc, you don't understand how the rest of the country functions. and if you are not from nyc, you have no idea how nyc functions.**   something i can only say after driving around the country in a van, doing touring theatre, hanging out with audience members, and trying to live out of motels. depends on who is saying it and if they are being condescending while expressing their views. they are many parts of living here that are awful, exclusionary, and unsafe that may drive me out of the city in the future despite having built a full life here me: \\\"i agree.\\\"  i just... there are some things to \\\\*like\\\\* about nyc, but there are a lot of things to \\\\*loathe\\\\* about nyc  that's just me. i know a lot of people can live a pretty steady, consistent life in here with very little trouble. i admire and honestly am jealous bye.  the door is to the left.  see you never. i hope you're happy where you land. \\u201cyeah, you couldn\\u2019t\\u201d me too i miss ny a lot! moved to dallas a few months ago and i want to go back haha i can\\u2019t find the same parks here, can\\u2019t find the same quality food at restaurants, everything is better in ny.  it\\u2019s definitely more stinky in some places in ny but that\\u2019s city life, if people don\\u2019t like city life they wouldn\\u2019t like many walking cities honestly. it\\u2019s funny how it js socially acceptable to say \\u201ci could never live in (big city)\\u201d but if you say \\u201ci could never live in (suburban town)\\u201d you\\u2019re being rude. i just nod and agree with them.   a. i want to keep rent down b. i've made my own life out for myself here are the last 5 years and if i wanted people from my rural hometown in my regular life still i would've moved back home. i grew up in iowa so i completely understand as far as cleanliness, environment, physical space, quiet etc. but personally i was bored outta my damn mind there and they really can't comprehend the lifestyle you live out here. ya you\\u2019re right, you couldn\\u2019t i usually say i could never live where they live. okay would you like to list anything else you don\\u2019t do? should i start listing the things i don\\u2019t do? sorry i\\u2019m not so good with weird conversations. why would i care? i can never live in any random suburb but they sure do \\\"i don't know how you can live here.\\\" anyone that has said this to me hasn\\u2019t ever even visited new york good, rent is expensive enough. can you imagine if everyone wanted to live here? \\u201cyeah i don\\u2019t think you could either\\u201d i get it, you don't have the mental fortitude :) new york is devastated by you not being there it takes a certain kind of person to live here. sometimes i wonder whether i am cut out for it. but it is the city that puts all others to shame. i can walk out my door and never hop in a car or even a train and do all of my grocery shopping, go to the gym, sit and read by the waterfront or in a nearby park, decide on dinner at 20 restaurants 300 feet away, and watch the lights flicker on just as the sun sets. i can hear 5 different languages just walking to get breakfast. i have my choice of 10 different coffee shops to do wfh. i can thrift free art and furniture right off the street. maybe there\\u2019s a city or two in europe that could, perhaps, match some of the vibes i get here. but if i were a betting man, my money would always be on the sui generis of cities. \\u201ci know, i can tell\\u201d and look at them smugly. it\\u2019s interesting that this is such a common comment - i would never think to turn to someone who lives in kansas and declare that i could never live how they live. it would be so condescending for me to say that as a new yorker, but somehow the reverse is not\\u2026? maybe because it\\u2019s \\u201cpunching up\\u201d aka the city is so obviously desirable there\\u2019s a reason so many of the world\\u2019s most popular shows and movies take place here and it\\u2019s packed to the gills with people trying to make it here. for this reason i usually shrug it off as little sister behavior. ![gif](giphy|j8fzim9vobu6q) yeah it\\u2019s not for the weak the city weeds out the bitches. \\u201ci could never live in *insert town or suburb where they live*. i don\\u2019t know how people can live there.\\u201d \\u201cnot surprised\\u201d okay would you like to list anything else you don\\u2019t do? should i start listing the things i don\\u2019t do? sorry i\\u2019m not so good with weird conversations. my cousin who lives in a trailer in bumfuck, backwoods usa said he could never live here and i just laughed and replied \\u201coh i agree, this city isn\\u2019t for the weak.\\u201d some people aren\\u2019t built to handle how tough it is either \\u201cyeah, i don\\u2019t think you could either\\u201d or \\u201ci couldn\\u2019t live where you live either\\u201d \\ud83d\\ude02 \\u201c8.3 million people live here so its actually not that hard?\\u201d don\\u2019t. a friend and his wife were flabbergasted when i told them that after a weekend of complaining how much they would never live in nyc while crashing at my place. not with that attitude! yeah you probably couldn\\u2019t. \\\"who says we want you here?\\\" this is a classic republican/trump attitude, so i view it as very political. \\\"i'm sorry your mental weakness is drowning out your statement, please rephrase \\\" \\ud83e\\udd37\\ud83c\\udffb\\u200d\\u2642\\ufe0f you\\u2019re right, you couldn\\u2019t. \\u201cis that not a rude thing to say where you\\u2019re from?\\u201d good thing nobody\\u2019s inviting you. only the strongest survives new york. i'd say, you don't know what you're talking about. fuck you!\\u00a0 or \\\"to each, his own\\\" i say \\u201cgood\\u201d we don\\u2019t want you here. you weren\\u2019t invited then don\\u2019t there\\u2019s only one answer. \\u201cfuggisyoutalmbout?\\u201d you either love it or hate it! it\\u2019s great that you don\\u2019t then :) i tell them nyc has 8 million people so maybe you should stfu and learn something ![gif](giphy|j8fzim9vobu6q) then dont shut up  go sit over there  please go away \\u201cyeah you definitely couldn\\u2019t!\\u201d my mom always says this. great, you\\u2019ve chosen where you want to live and i\\u2019ve chosen where i ant to live. i don\\u2019t spend all my time telling you how much i hate where you live why do you do it to me lol i say. fuck you. you want to but you can\\u2019t it\\u2019s usually some fools stuck in an echo chamber of disinformation showing random photos of fire, broken windows, and wrecked police cars from 2020. but yeah, no place like ny. i travel quite a bit, have had to move all over for work, and i always miss ny in the end. don\\u2019t let the door hit you in the ass! adios!!! you have to be tough to live in new york a friend of mine lived in new york city had a dog named taxi. \\u201cyeah, it\\u2019s not for everybody.\\u201d tell them they probably wouldn\\u2019t be happy here and they should stay where they are. i moved to brooklyn in 2006-straight from college and been here since. could not imagine living anywhere else!!! go fuck yourself! we aren't exactly \\\"living\\\" ![gif](giphy|1msy0o1ma3bslybzua|downsized) ![gif](giphy|ldbuyzawu8l4i|downsized)  \\\"then, don't\\\" the people who say this would so obviously get eaten alive that i\\u2019m not bothered anymore. they can keep thinking that when you live in nyc there\\u2019s someone lurking around every corner to stab you and no one speaks english or whatever fb told them. at least i make more than $7/hour and i have the option to fuck someone who isn\\u2019t my second cousin. that's fine. say don\\u2019t. you have no idea what you\\u2019re missing. i lived here my whole life. and love it \\\"you can't handle it, it's okay.\\\" i agree. [deleted] \\\"i'm here, in one piece and as financially ranked as the rest of us.\\\" same probably you get used to it.  (i'm a transplant) \\ud83d\\udc4d\\ud83c\\udffd \\u201cya know, that reminds me of an old yogi berra saying\\u201d \\\"me neither, can i leave?\\\" good i know ok then. it's not for everyone and honestly a lot of people complain about creature comforts. i always thought of it as look at the city as your extended living room and you've got every opportunity open to you.  it's not some peoples cup of tea and that's perfectly ok.   i mean, i could never live in new jersey. \\ud83d\\ude43 https://preview.redd.it/ay8qe0graiid1.jpeg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=922157c92e472d2f8b90ce9ad6e3c64a1d5380aa  i be like cool i'll enjoy this view regardless. good the rents too damn high already \\ud83e\\udd37\\ud83c\\udffb\\u200d\\u2640\\ufe0f \\u201ci hate driving.\\u201d \\\"lol same. i like the quality of life though. could never live where you do\\\" nyc has the highest high and lowest lows. i love what makes it great way more than disdain what makes it challenging. \\u201cyeah i completely get you, a lot of people i know can\\u2019t afford it too\\u201d cool. i can\\u2019t live in gaithersburg either.  (actual convo with a friend of mine from maryland) i don't know how i live here either. slow blink and stare. my response is basically what others have commented, \\\"ok\\\". but i sometimes think i should have answered, \\\"why does someone living in new york make you feel the need to defend not living in new york?\\\" great, don't. it\\u2019s not for the weak \\u201cfacts. idk how i live here\\u201d \\u201cthat\\u2019s because your a lil bitch\\u201d we're full anyways \\ud83e\\udd23 well...i don't know how anyone can live here. note: where ever they live. go kick rocks! but also ok good! we don\\u2019t want no more transplants lol i mean i\\u2019ve lived here for 10 years and own a house in brooklyn and i still kind of feel like i can\\u2019t live here the first thing to remember when someone says this is it has nothing to do with you. they are just stating their preference (even if not worded well). so just don't take it personally.  everyone has preferences. usually i say something like \\\"i hear you\\\" which validates / witnesses their point of view without giving up mine. aaaaaannnnnnndddddd? i\\u2019ve always believed myself a better human for having lived there. ight ok boomer it is helpful to know why they say that. if it\\u2019s money, it\\u2019s rhetorical. but sometimes it\\u2019s bc it seems overwhelming, too big, too anonymous\\u2014to which i say, but each neighborhood is a small enclave. you get to know your local small grocer on the corner, your mail person, etc. and then when you walk further out, there\\u2019s the vital energy. you start to know which streets to walk, for when you want low-key energy and a direct passage. then another day, you want the variety and the hustle and bustle. i always feel seen in ny, and i equally *see* so many people. a main reason why i love it. give me your wallet! yeah rats are an acquired taste \\u201ci could visit the m&m store but i couldn\\u2019t live in the m&m store\\u201d cool lol but also same because it\\u2019s so unreal here lol when i'm feeling spicy: \\\"yeah, you gotta be tough and smart. not everyone can handle it. nothing wrong with that.\\\"   the last part being said in a tone of voice that insinuates there is, in fact, something wrong with that. *shrugs* \\u201cso don\\u2019t\\u201d get the f out in god speed there is a great new song by morgan st jean - \\u201cme this time.\\u201d  choosing nyc over a relationship.  i would play it for them mofo leave lol new york is always two decades ahead...imo \\u201cnyc is more than just time square and midtown.\\u201d \\\"i understand\\\" \\\"i agree\\\" the patrice o'neal head tilt/shoulder shrug but with the absolute minimum effort possible. of course you couldn't, dear (smiles sympathetically) i send them this video  https://youtu.be/tnpoplflt1w?si=gkripvvihmx4a0hr stay where you\\u2019re comfortable. i\\u2019m going to explore and discover myself. tell them to enjoy olive garden and everything closing at 8pm, we dont miss you it\\u2019s not for everyone i would never live in the suburbs of [atlanta / dallas / charlotte] k cool okay \\u201csame\\u201d there are more than a million people who disagree more for me ppl are always going to have something to say that could rub you the wrong way. it\\u2019s annoying but i\\u2019ve learned to just not engage. shrug your shoulders, nod, and move on to the next topic. \\u201cso anyway\\u2026\\u201d ppl aren\\u2019t going to change their opinions and you\\u2019re better off letting it go than letting it aggravate you.  don\\u2019t waste your time or energy! just my 2 cents! \\\"that's fair.\\\" because they probably have a point of two that is legitimate and probably not being confrontational perse. everyone has their preferences. why they decided to blurt that out loud depends on the situation i guess. why make care payments or car insurance payments or gasoline payments when everything is a block away folks in my hometown often say that but i think they mean it as a compliment, rather than an insult.   as i interpret it, they found the hustle and bustle of new york intimidating when they visited, so they are \\u201cin awe\\u201d (heavy air quotes there - i\\u2019m not so narcissistic i think they\\u2019re actually awed by me) of my ability to handle the grit, the trains, the noise, the directness, etc.   i tend to respond, \\u201coh i love it, it\\u2019s been a great fit for me.\\u201d keeps my pride intact without being dismissive. good. \\u201cyeop, only some people can take it.\\u201d being this poor must suck a lot of people won't admit what they don't know.\\u00a0 good for them for admitting it. good thing it\\u2019s me and not you \\u201cgood thing you don\\u2019t\\u201d \\u201ci don\\u2019t know how i could live here myself, still trying to figure that out\\u201d laughter i get it. this place kinda sucks. i mean i can totally see why someone wouldn\\u2019t want to live here. it\\u2019s not for everyone and as someone who\\u2019s lived here most of my life it does get frustrating sometimes. i moved from a quiet neighborhood in the midwest to new york and my response is \\u201ceh, ya get used to it after a bit\\u201d \\u201cyeah i get it. that\\u2019s how i feel about the suburbs\\u201d i tell them \\u201cthat\\u2019s great, bc i could never live where you live either.\\u201d and just look at their face, waiting for the irony to hit. \\u201cwell millions of people do so it must work somehow!\\u201d same! want to grab a coffee at park and 125th? i tell them i can't wait to get out too. then don\\u2019t - we have enough people already\\ud83d\\ude00 \\u201cprobably for the best. you\\u2019re not strong enough to handle it anyway\\u201d \\\"that was always allowed\\\" my husband agrees with them and says \\u201cyeah, you wouldn\\u2019t make it here.\\u201d \\u201cyeah, i totally hear you\\u201d  lifelong manhattanite going on 53, i get why people say that. it\\u2019s such a specific lifestyle. \\u201cyea, it\\u2019s not for everyone\\u201d that\\u2019s why the city is so empty! \\u201cnot everyone can live here\\u201d lmao \\u201cthe struggle is real.\\u201d this tickled me. just moved back to manhattan with my husband and four year old after a decade in the burbs. i don't know why everyone is so offended by this question. there's lots of places i wouldn't live either and would say the exact same thing about. that\\u2019s ok, it\\u2019s just not for you, don\\u2019t blame yourself. yeah, it\\u2019s not for everyone we don\\u2019t want you. nothing. i don\\u2019t care. \\u201cyeah, ny would probably eat you alive. it\\u2019s not for everyone.\\u201d \\u201ci don\\u2019t know how i live here either.\\u201d \\\"i dont blame you, it sucks\\\" the irony of wanting to live in nyc when i was broke vs being able to afford it now and not wanting to \\ud83d\\ude02 it\\u2019s funny how people say stuff like that not even knowing how nyc is or have never been there\\u2026. i agree i tell them - please go - makes more room for the people who truly want to be here. i tell them there is a waiting list for almost all apts. in ny and if there isn't then there is something wrong with the apt.   i tell people that the trick in life is to find a place where you like to live  - and then live there. \\u201cgood. new york is pretty full.\\u201d \\u201cit aint for everybody\\u201d + \\ud83e\\udd37\\ud83c\\udffd\\u200d\\u2640\\ufe0f then it\\u2019s a good thing you don\\u2019t! my response is i don\\u2019t blame you that\\u2019s a feature, not a bug there's a reason it's in every type of media to each their own. it\\u2019s def not for everyone. some people like space and peace and quiet. others want to live in the middle of all the action.  it\\u2019s a weird trend where everyone has to attack or defend where they live. if you like it there who gives af lol my wife and i moved back in february after 14 very pleasant years in the charleston suburbs. liked it well enough there, but always felt like this was home, could never really lean hard into life there. my standard response is \\\"it's not for everybody.\\\" there are plenty of things that suck about living here, i'm not totally sure this was the right call for us in our middle age years, but..like everywhere else would feel like i was on the outside looking in. literally 10-20 million people exist here just fine. most of the entire globe lives in places like nyc \\ud83e\\udd37\\ud83c\\udffe\\u200d\\u2640\\ufe0f then don\\u2019t i don\\u2019t know how i live here either well it depends where. i live eastern long island and it's expensive but so beautiful i wouldn't want to live anywhere else did i ask you? \\\"sir, this is a wendy's\\\" that\\u2019s right. you couldn\\u2019t. so many people scared of nyc for little reason. imo only drawback is cost of living. \\u201coh yeah, not everyone\\u2019s mentally strong enough to live in the city. good for you for knowing that about yourself.\\u201d non-condescending: \\u201ck\\u201d. condescending: \\u201cnot everyone can handle it\\u201d.  ultra-condescending: \\u201cactually, i really love it here. i\\u2019m so happy.\\u201d \\u201cthat\\u2019s how i feel about *insert their town*\\u201d i live in ny and as soon as i complete my latest project i am out of here and away from houckle. i agree with them. \\u201cokay lol i agree ig\\u201d native nyer here, i get it. nyc is like david lynch movies, i think they are beautiful, fascinating, and often disturbing masterpieces, but i totally get that some people just wouldn\\u2019t like them at all or find them appealing in any way. \\u201cwe built different\\u201d \\\"yeah only certain kind of people can live here. it has its own way of weeding out the weak\\\" \\u201csame, and i\\u2019ve lived there 24 years\\u201d well stay where you are then. don\\u2019t worry bout it sweetheart. you don't have to respond. let people live in their little world. i agree im not asking for a roomate, uncle mark \\u201ci didn\\u2019t ask\\u201d or \\u201cyeah, a lot of people can\\u2019t hack it!\\u201d mind ya business \\\"okay leave\\\" i know this place is a shit hole \\u201ci get that\\u201d \\u201cyou\\u2019re right, you definitely couldn\\u2019t handle it here\\u201d i say i understand. i only came here for the art as an artist but that whole crowd is snooty political and male dominated and disgusting so about to leave after 20 years. sick of the abuse and anger, commutes. i feel like the art meca will not be here. a more annoying question is, how do you live there, homeless, dangerous, and so small good literally nothing because i don\\u2019t care. just smile. i will tell him straight to his face - \\u201cyou.. you.. you are totally right and the city became garbage\\u201d don\\u2019t come \\\"yeah, i can tell.\\\" whenever tourists at my job say this i just respond with \\u201cwow. devastating.\\u201d provincial snowflakes, they scared of chocolate colored people good! it's too crowded as it is. good to know your limits i grew up in la and have lived in new york for almost 20 years. i fairly often have a dodgers or lakers hat on and new yorkers fairly often tell me how much they hate la.   i\\u2019ve found that responding with \\u201cif i wanted your opinion i would have asked you\\u201d works pretty well.   same thing works here. you don\\u2019t have to make it about where they live, you just have to remind them that just because they have an opinion doesn\\u2019t mean they need to share it. \\\"cause i work here\\\" is usually my response. lol let me guess, it\\u2019s too expensive. \\u201ci love it, you don\\u2019t have to. it\\u2019s not for everyone.\\u201d i don\\u2019t engage with people like this. it's okay. we don't want you here anyway. ngl i mostly live here because i work here and don't want to commute. my coworkers from li have asked me how i live here, i just ask them what time they had to wake up to get to work and what time they will get home. for them it's 4:10am then they get home around 5:30. i get up at 6:10 and am usually home before 3pm. on the weekends they are usually sleeping in to catch up on sleep, while i'm still waking up at 6:10 feeling refreshed, then head to the beach or mountains. please don\\u2019t then. we have enough problems. go and live somewhere where you\\u2019re happy and spare us your ignorant opinions \\\"i didn't choose to be born here.\\\" is what i've told people. because i didn't lol. is this new york the state or new york city. i love my small town in upstate new york. \\ud83c\\udfb6 \\ud83c\\udfb5 where everybody know your name...\\ud83c\\udfb6 suck my dick nod/smile/walk away \\u201cnobody cares\\u201d good we got enough people from the middle of nowhere making tik tok videos here \\u201cyeah, not everyone has what it takes to succeed here socially or economically\\u201d *silence* different strokes for different folks. no need to stoop to something haughty. the same as anywhere else they go to work eat poop reproduce and so on it\\u2019s a really great is what i say. but what i think is if you have to ask why nyc you do not only not belong there but you will never get it. this kind of comment is likely not a personal value judgement. nyc is an objectively difficult place to eke out an existence. there are many reasons why someone would say they can\\u2019t or don\\u2019t want to live here that are in no way derogatory. l + ratio + didn\\u2019t ask good. we are full it does completely suck right now, would leave if i could it's a hard city, but you're never bored. everyday feels like a movie good, there's too many people already. we have a housing shortage. i\\u2019m sorry there\\u2019s no more room. it's pretty much how everyone used to live unless you were a farmer. i feel bad for them. \\\"i didn't ask\\\" nyc isn\\u2019t for the weak so i understand only the strong survive i simply say \\\"i like it,\\\" but i'm thinking [this](https://youtube.com/clip/ugkxb82j_rahxxae3wboxd9robiivk7f_0r2?si=hgwt5vjwoa826fqx). ![gif](giphy|7k2loeyky5i1hfewqb) them:\\\"i could nev-\\\" me: \\\"hard agree\\\" a lot of bitter & sassy answers in this thread. it\\u2019s not a personal attack if someone doesn\\u2019t want to live here. i moved out of that toilet a long time ago wouldn\\u2019t go back for all the money in the world. good. \\u201ccan i get a #3 with a large soda?\\u201d i usually respond with curiosity. oh, what makes you say that? then if they offer a negative assumption that isn\\u2019t true (it\\u2019s too dangerous, etc) i say, oh that hasn\\u2019t been my experience and then they usually stop.  sometimes i\\u2019ll say oh yea i get it- i could never live in the rural midwest, we all have our preferences and that also usually stops them   honestly it\\u2019s fine if both everyone wants to live here but usually when people say that it\\u2019s with a critical edge so i try to shut it down then i guess you shouldn\\u2019t. honestly man\\u2026 i don\\u2019t know how i can even live here anymore.  it\\u2019s gotten exponentially harder to find a fucking apartment since the last time i moved.  i\\u2019ve been couch surfing and subletting since april and i\\u2019m completely over it. i have family who are native new yorkers and i\\u2019m an la native. we both still reside in our home towns. we laugh about it. they have a choice. stay where you are and why do you care where we live? we do not say anything about where they live. ny and la

with them this place is a dump. good. good. don\\u2019t come here, we have enough real new yorkers already living here. that i hate it to and feel stuck here to the people who have asked me that, my response was   \\\"don't believe everything you see in movies or on the news. yes its true we have crime and our mayor sucks but there is more to ny than the 5 boroughs. alot of people live in very beautiful areas that are safe and only commute to manhattan for work\\\" i tell them we're glad not to have them. i agree: you couldn\\u2019t as someone from nyc i\\u2019d say i agree \\ud83e\\udd23 \\u201cyes, as a new yorker i can say it is pretty bad. stay out\\u201d. this way, hopefully, we can bring the rent down and enjoy our city with those who love it, like i do. to each their own that\\u2019s great, but if you can make it in new york baby, you can make it anywhere. maybe you\\u2019re just not cut out to be a boss you weren\\u2019t even invited \\u2764\\ufe0f stop being a big lippy puss nobody  who lives in the greatest  city in the universe cares..\\ud83d\\ude0a\\ud83d\\ude04\\ud83d\\ude01\\ud83d\\ude42 and plears,please...stay away,your not wanted  and we don't  need you!!!!!\\ud83d\\ude0e a lot of people find nyc overwhelming. i was born here so it's second nature. however, i went to pitt and didn't have a single friend from pittsburgh who successfully tried to transition to nyc. most lasted a year, some a bit longer. you love it or you don't that\\u2019s great, don\\u2019t good luck, babe \\u270c\\ufe0f i tell them they\\u2019re right. the city could do much better to take care of its constituents. i shrug and say it\\u2019s actually better when you live there. visiting can be stressful, but when you have home to get back to and you generally know your way around, it\\u2019s a great place to live. \\u201ci agree. it\\u2019s unlikely you would be able to make it out here.\\u201d not sure that requires any response. \\\"time is a construct and capitalism is killing us all, i don't know how people live anywhere.\\\" so don\\u2019t live here you\\u2019re so right! i have a couple of cousins who always make remarks about me living in nyc. i just tell them, \\\"it's not for the weak\\\" fuck off. i say i love the energy. it is the capital of the universe. the news o it reports on the crime. very safe. good, leave \\u201cyeah you\\u2019re right. you probably couldn\\u2019t \\u201c it\\u2019s not for everyone.   most nyers could never live in really rural areas; same concept. you don\\u2019t need a response. i just say it\\u2019s not for everybody.i remember a friend told me i need to move out of new york and how bad it is blah blah blah all because she moved to pennsylvania,so i told her it\\u2019s not that easy for me to move long story short she ended up getting evicted from her apartment and now she\\u2019s back in new york lol. \\u201cwhere else then?\\u201d awhile ago, we were afraid that you would move here! \\u201cf@ck otf\\u201d thank god because we don\\u2019t need people like you here lol good, stay out. i would scream that i agree \\\"yeah, you probably aren't strong enough\\\". but then they get all

other \\ud83d\\udc4d we lived in nyc for 2 decades as an adult including several years in midtown, after moving out, i don\\u2019t think i would want to live there even if someone gave a free apartment. \\\"i don't know either\\\" because it's true, i'm not cut out for it & at the same time i don't wanna leave... \\\"good.\\\" i mean good don\\u2019t fucking live here there\\u2019s almost 9 million people here. live in your boring suburb of dallas and tweet about your truck and freedom. shut the fuck up and stay there.

giving you a little insight into their preferences.  why is everyone always looking for a reason to be butt hurt?  look for a reason to be grateful, or find joy in things, and touch some grass in central park. we don\\u2019t want you here either \\\"i agree, this place sucks. wish i could leave\\\" yea i can see that you wouldn\\u2019t be a good fit there anyways \\u201ccool. don\\u2019t.\\u201d no need to take offense when people say that. a lot of people don't like the loud city environment and high rent. if you live in ny, you know it's not perfect. my sister says that to me all the time. most of the times, i just smile and change the topic.  but few times i have responded \\u201c i can't live at a place where i have to drive everywhere.  every ones different.\\u201d good! don\\u2019t! there\\u2019s already enough ohio transplants in zara jackets and baggy jeans clogging up the sidewalk. thank god, we dont need anyone like you \\u201cthat\\u2019s fine.\\u201d  i totally get it. it isn\\u2019t for everyone and that is okay. i love it. sometimes it feels like an abusive relationship, but it is hard to imagine living anywhere else unless it is also a large city where i don\\u2019t *need* a car. \\u201cdid someone ask you to live here?\\u201d \\\"you're right, you could never live here\\\" scrolling (not all the way so relax) are there any real answers? other than, \\\"no one asked you to\\\" or similar (by the way, those people make this place tough to live in \\ud83d\\ude02)   proximity to nyc, beaches, schools, family, road trip to most of east coast, great jobs? i can totally see why people live there, i just don't understand how you afford to good! it's already too crowded. *internally thinks to self* \\u201cidk how i live here either\\u201d i just say imagine california. \\ud83d\\ude02 \\u201cand that\\u2019s why you don\\u2019t\\u201d truuue i get don\\u2019t get why so many so called new yorkers here in the comments can\\u2019t imagine how life in nyc is objectively harder than if we lived anywhere else. like if someone said this to me i\\u2019d be like \\u201ci know! rent is crazy in nyc\\u201d   like it\\u2019s not a personal attack, it\\u2019s just true. it\\u2019s crazy dense, the rent is unbelievable the taxes wild, the proximity and density of humans per block is 5-10x any other us city.   for better or for worse yes we\\u2019re all here for a reason, but don\\u2019t pretend your quality of life would not improve if you left. it\\u2019s not always a put down if someone says they could never live here. it\\u2019s a lot! well it\\u2019s good you dont \\u201cit\\u2019s definitely not for the weak\\u201d yeah, but are the rats in oklahoma living like kings? didn\\u2019t think so. \\u201ci know, it\\u2019s a horrible city but it\\u2019s where my job is.\\u201d i would live in ny if i had the money to do it in style. think terrace instead of balcony. great. don\\u2019t. i lived in new york and i wish i listened to the people who told me this. the city is a shit-ridden scum factory. people weren't meant to live like that. i rightfully judge people who genuinely enjoy it. me neither then don\\u2019t. then don\\u2019t move here fine. there\\u2019s enough of us here already. shit ain\\u2019t easy out here my boy!!!!!! i sometimes think i wouldn't want to if i weren't a native.  but only every other day. just means i'm stronger than you why is this such a common thing for people to say?! i\\u2019ve had multiple people say that to me and i\\u2019m always so confused. i wouldn\\u2019t say that about where they live. depends but sometimes just a \\u201cthat\\u2019s awesome, glad you know that! i dont know how you could live here either. :)\\u201d to each their own. it\\u2019s not for the weak. the city doesn't need anymore transplants trying to live their best \\\"friends,\\\" \\\"sex and the city,\\\" or \\\"broad city\\\" lifestyle, so it's okay!\\ud83d\\udc4c\\ud83c\\udffe same. it\\u2019s an over expensive pile of litter and smells like garbage. cool museums and parks though and fun for day trips! you\\u2019re right; you couldn\\u2019t \\\"it's not for the weak\\\" are the majority of the people answering this question  transplants? how many people are talking to people that don't live here? most of friends and family are from here. how often are you guys getting asked this question? and by whom? \\u201ci respect your opinion.\\u201d i agree my response is always \\u201cyeah it sucks.\\u201d because it does. i\\u2019m convinced most of you have a fantasy image of what this city is based on movies and tv that clouds your perception of reality.\",\n          \"this has been happening for years but its reach is even wider today. nyc for the less wealthy are offered \\u201cglorified dorms.\\u201d the use the cheapest material, most confusing layouts and tiniest of rooms, but oh! there\\u2019s a pet spa on the roof \\ud83d\\ude44 you must be new here. and you left out one important thing...closets!!! people need closets. anything that doesn't fit in your closets has to be in your living space. i've seen some new apartments in brooklyn, overpriced but doable for me, but tiny closets. so frustrating \\ud83d\\ude24 looking now. good income/credit but a dismal experience. i went to an open house in the ev today, and 50 people showed up. a 150 sf apt; the studio room was so small the frig was squeezed between the (full/double) bed and the wall. 2200. wtf. i applied for a place slightly bigger, les, not great at all; it's been a week since they haven't answered my app. they asked for more financial information, which i gave them. they are obviously going from the richest applicant on down. i'm in a nice airbnb, a beautiful place, and same price as a regular apt but deep bk....ugh damn bro. you didn\\u2019t have to call out my living situation like that lmao i looked at an apartment once. it was gorgeous and was being subletted by the owner (which was a turn off to me anyway because i didn\\u2019t want to deal with that). and there was no refrigerator. actually there were two \\u201cmini fridges\\u201d the type i had in my dorm in college. how does one function without a fridge? for 3,000 a month?! insane you are correct on all of the above. i am moving into a much older apartment next month. you forgot about the lack of kitchens in these new buildings. i have yet to see a new apartment with a proper kitchen. it's always just kitchen stuff along one wall in the living room. what's next? a toilet in the corner of the bedroom? yes. >*it's like the developers tried to squeeze in just one too many units per floor which ended up making the square footage of all the units on the floor borderline unlivable.*  correct. i think one of the issues is that a large part of the market for these apartments are young people with roommates and who don't really care too much about long-term quality-of-life, or life inside their home when nyc is out there waiting for them, or having a reasonable budget that will allow them to live long-term (whether they're kind of yoloing on their own salary or have family assistance to pay the rent).  >*legitimately, how the fuck does anyone making less than 100k per year survive in this city?*  they probably do not live in new builds. lots of people will live in multiple-income households one way or another. and they hunt for deals and pounce on them immediately. and of course, dual or more incomes help a lot compared to a single income.  my first and longest-occupied apartment in nyc was a large one-bedroom in a rent-stabilized 1920's pre-war elevator tenement building in brooklyn. it usually didn't have cockroaches or mice, and it was pretty large, good light, on the top floor, and in reasonable condition, so i loved it. however, it was pretty crappy by anywhere-else standards. plus they're hard to get into. i got very lucky.  my wife and i live in a less-than-20-year-old condo-style building now, and it's nice and affordable for our income today, but it was a very, very lucky find. the broker half-joked that she loved showing this apartment because it was actually adult-sized.  most of our friends are pretty reasonably paid professionals, lots of couples, and my wife and i are the closest to living in a \\\"luxury\\\" new build of anyone at this point. friends live in older tenement-style buildings or partial brownstones.  the older the stock gets, the more it tends to be adult-livable and was better constructed. a lot of this is survivorship bias as much as anything... anything built to very low standards a hundred years ago was probably knocked down fifty years ago.  >*hopefully this city gets it together and eventually starts building way more apartments (with actually livable floor plans).*  yeah, i hope so. in the meantime dig around in queens and brooklyn for something older. make a list of your must-haves and dealbreakers and focus on things other people hate that you don't mind.  when my wife and i started dating she had a nice deal on a one-bedroom by herself because it was on the sixth floor of a non-elevator building. i had a goth friend who lived in manhattan long ago and really liked living in a dark cave, so she got a good deal on a low-floor courtyard apartment. given the timeframe, they were both making around today's equivalent of $80k taking inflation into account.  was still tough for both of them given the pay at the time, but they made it work living alone.  when i first moved here, the broker showed me a similar dark-cave ground-floor interior apartment for like 2/3 the price of the one i eventually lived in. but that was a dealbreaker for me.  if you make significantly less than $80k in today's dollars, and are just moving to nyc, i think many people are looking at roommates/housemates, family (living with them or getting help from), or incredible luck.  my first building was full of retirees and working people who could afford their rent-stabilized places partially because they'd been there a long, long time. i think my next-door neighbor had lived there for 45 years and raised her kids there. she was a retired emergency-room nurse.  rent stabilization/control is a good thing imo, for long-term life, but yeah, we also need significant up-market construction of good quality housing to take the pressure off for people who want to move here now. this is why you always want to find an apt in a pre war building. solid walls and larger rooms. saw a $1 million condo in queens a few years ago that was new construction and same thing. not even a deeded parking spot for that price and no parking near the building i\\u2019ve been living in new builds / luxury apts for 5 years and i\\u2019m so so excited to move to a pre war. there so much bs to deal with in a big luxury building including an incompetent management plus everything you mentioned.   the only luxury buildings that seem worth in are in bk or manhattan and even then there\\u2019s only certain buildings that are really good\\u2014 and studios in those buildings are at least 3.8k so here we are. honestly, i prefer prewar buildings. high ceilings and large bedrooms all the way. on top of it, they all lie about their square footage on the listings lmao welcome to late stage capitalism first time? roommate if you don\\u2019t make atleast 150k.  manhattan is a terrible place to live unless you\\u2019re making bank. go live outside of manhattan.  three types of ppl that lives in manhattan: 1) high earners 2) out of state folks that watches sex and the city  3) government housing folks. look for older buildings, over 100 yrs, in queens, bronx or brooklyn for large size rooms and apartments. the only way to afford it nowadays is to split rent with a partner (or roommate) and live 1-2 hours' commuting distance to manhattan.  my partner and i had a decent place in nj for a year, but the commute through port authority took years off my life, so we ultimately ended up in rockaway park, which is nice because it's at the beach, but it's like 1.5 hour from anywhere.  we rent the second floor of a single-family home from our landlord who lives below us.  we only got a good deal for this reason--we went through craiglist instead of an agency.  no fees or bullshit, and he never raises the rent.  unless you can get lucky with a private landlord, it's hell. this isn't just nyc. it's all new developer led construction in the country. look at places queens /brooklyn. not cheap but you get more space for your money. everyone wants to live in manhattan and there\\u2019s only so much space. as a liver in one of those weird apartments (housing connect so worth) if you can add door shelves and organization stuff from wayfair etc to the closet, it can become the dresser for you. makes no difference functionally (might be easier to find things too) and not having to place a big dresser helps the rest of the apartment layout fall in place. landed yesterday? 150sf?  for the whole place? that's 12'x 12' . my kid has a 600sf  in sutton place at that price point always has been \\ud83c\\udf0e\\ud83e\\uddd1\\u200d\\ud83d\\ude80 \\ud83d\\udd2b\\ud83d\\udc68\\ud83c\\udffd\\u200d\\ud83d\\ude80 my 2008 build apt in atlanta is way nicer than the 2022 built one i had in ny metro. the build quality in new builds here still feels weird but the amenities make up for it. tons of amenity space, hard to find that in nyc without paying obscene amounts. i wish carpet was back in style (yes, i know it's dirty, but that soft feel is amazing, nyc unfortunately never had a carpet phase) and i wish floor to ceiling windows or otherwise giant windows went out of style (i like privacy more than light). totally agreed. people making less than 100k have roommates. the natives stay with parents for a long time. or people live in huge older apartments rented a long time ago from mom and pop landlords but they deal with a bad commute (20 mins bus ride to a train). i\\u2019ve done all these things, and i\\u2019ve also had the luxury studio to myself (in a neighborhood that most transplants wouldn\\u2019t tolerate). i\\u2019m over it and i\\u2019ve decided that it\\u2019s not worth it to be here. yes the new builds are terrible and probably violating building code behind the drywall. also watch out for crazy electric bills in new or refurbished units, with no real reason why. what you\\u2019ve noticed is what gets lost with the \\u201cbuild more housing\\u201d crowd. we are getting shitty builds that get evermore expensive. you just said what everyone who is either from here or has been living here for over 15 years has been thinking and feeling. it's bs. i'm in the midst of moving so i'm viewing apartment after apartment and quite frankly, it's disrespectful. my roommate and i finally found a real nice place off the j/m at myrtle-broadway, it wasn't renovated but it still was nice and had all the space we needed/ wanted... they were asking $5800 !!!!!!!! for a 2 bedroom duplex. with no curb appeal. nyc has gotten out of control. i'm over it. this is my last place. kitchen islands so big that there's no usable space in the living room to put a couch and tv newer construction typically follows a pretty limited set of layouts - very few closets, pullman style kitchen, and ~120 sqft bedrooms. they'll typically spend more effort on hyping up amenities or the appliances or whatever, which cost nothing compared to the real estate and construction. it's a little depressing. i live in comparatively new construction but i managed to avoid most of that. the last part of your comment is the most important. more housing needs to be built in \\\"high opportunity areas.\\\" tell your elected officials. :( ![gif](giphy|ocmgluo7d5jj6) new construction units get smaller n smaller!  if that\\u2019s your preference then deal with the high price n small square footage!  otherwise look for prewar buildings. the cost of construction (and land) in nyc is so high that any new building is going to have rent that\\u2019s commensurate with the building\\u2019s cost. as someone who has lived in manhattan most of my life, and just left a job in real estate after 10 years, no one moves to new york city for the space. the best you should hope for is to have an apartment with nice light. lol my apartment is literally a plus sign as the floor plan and i can only fit my queen bed in my wife and i\\u2019s room. barely a dining table and a couch which we haven\\u2019t purchased a couch yet because i have no idea what size loveseat would fit in our living room/ dining room. rent here is 3,500+ for a two bedroom. i live in the south bronx honestly if you are in a place in your life where you can rent a condo, do it. it\\u2019s not always a great fit with roommates or guarantors or people who struggle with paperwork or need to move right away.   the floor plans are so much better.   also i realize not everyone wants or needs a tenant agent, and this time of year it can be hard to get one, but we can steer you towards places with good layouts.   also being flexible with location helps immensely.  best of luck,  suzanne older buildings are vastly superior to new construction!!!! much more livable and the window units are really not even a con. easy to control how hot/cold you want each room highly recommend looking deep into brooklyn, you\\u2019d be surprised how commutable it is into midtown and below. heavy on the half glass shower it\\u2019s so stupid and the thin walls. that\\u2019s my apartment to a tee. exactly why i stay in my rundown dilapidated building. this is what happens when you effectively ban new construction. all the \\u201cnew housing\\u201d is just put into terrible floorplates. kitchens and living rooms are not included in this playset \\ud83d\\ude2c a lot of new apartments are also really poorly built even when they're expensive/luxury buildings etc the new units are so so so small don't forget, the ceilings are very short. and the heating is electric, so your electric bill is an extra 300 per month. welcome to new york. it\\u2019s been waiting for you. but what gets me is 800,000 people have reportedly left since 2020. how is the vacancy rate 1.4%??? like and before anyone answers migrants apparently the recent wave was around 200,000 but many have been moved to other cities and i\\u2019m not trying to be a bitch, but i have my doubts about migrants being responsible for the housing squeeze considering how harsh nyc landlords are about paperwork and income. as a native nyer, i'm moving to jersey because this shit is rigged. roommates and living further out in crappier neighborhoods. we need a r/nycapartmenetsrant sub i mean, there's a reason why pre-war buildings historically valuate much more highly than stereotypical new construction.  i live in a brownstone and a car ran into it. the car fared much worse. i loved my seven years in manhattan.  on a weekend out in the hamptons during year three, i made my exit plan.  i realized that the quality of life was horrible for the price and, unless i was very, very rich and had a second home someplace else, i would have only sloppy seconds.  the best decision of my life was that exit plan, but moving there was my second-best decision.  pay up and live in the center of it for awhile.   then decide it you want to scramble for sloppy seconds for the rest of your life. it\\u2019s just you. no one has ever noticed or mentioned it before, thanks for speaking up! move to jersey city no, not really my experience. maybe you are going too low dollar? yeah, it\\u2019s evil isn\\u2019t it? welcome to my apartment \\ud83d\\ude02 the only reason we can afford it is because it\\u2019s rent stabilized (thanks housing lottery!). my two bedroom retails for like $3200/month. yep. been there. had a storage unit tried all of them! manhattan mini, local locker, cube smart. cube smart made my clothes smell like cat piss. you are absolutely correct! the developers who are building these new apartments are building what i would say are the smallest spaces i have ever seen. for example, there is a development company that are constructing apartments with bedrooms so small, only a twin size beds could fit in them. moreover, the bathrooms only have showers (no tubs) that are so narrow, one could barely turn around in them. the door also hits the sink in the bathroom. all for the fantastic price of $3000+\\u2019per month! it\\u2019s ridiculous! i think ny is moving away from trying to accommodate families! people making less than 100k get roommates often 3 or more. and as long as people keep reassuring landlords their apartments are amazing and going into droves for their shitty apartments its gonna keep getting smaller and pricier.  meanwhile there's mice, roaches, and black mold going rampant behind the scenes. the funny thing about the word luxury is...if you have to say it in the name, it's not luxury. it's a label for common man, not the wealthy.  things that are luxurious just...are, there is no need to label them, everyone knows it is luxury. when you slap luxury on the label of something, the only thing you can be certain of, is that it is not actually luxurious. if more people would actually believe what a shithole nyc has turned into after pandemic, fewer surprises like this would have happened. the city has lost its charm. predatory landlord and uninhabitable properties are a norm now. the apartment i live in isn\\u2019t tiny, doesn\\u2019t have a weird floor plan, poor build quality, egregious pricing and it\\u2019s not labeled as a \\u201cluxury\\u201d apartment. so to answer your questions no you must be taking crazy pills or you\\u2019re ignoring the dozens of apartment listings that don\\u2019t fit that criteria. don't forget your bathroom will be as big as your bedroom because of mandatory wheelchair accessibility lmao the major brokerages in nyc are sothebys ( where i worked), douglas elliman, brown harris, corcoran, compass. i would call the front desk and ask if any of the agents are good at rentals and/or are new and looking for clients. i can send you names if you like. get rid of the zoning laws and processes in place to make building as difficult as possible.   this country has a weird obsession with \\u201cpreserving the character\\u201d of a neighborhood, or whatever the fuck that means. most of the existing residential buildings in manhattan should have been torn down and rebuilt decades ago. [deleted] sounds like you\\u2019re looking at conversions. new york has a population density of 27,485  people per square mile. compare that with houston at 3,614 or phoenix at 3,105. what do you expect, gigantic apartments for a cheap price? they could build more skyscrapers but the construction costs increase geometrically with the height of the building.  since you new yorkers like to live in top of each other, you've got to pay the price. either live in an apartment the size of a broom closet or pay an exorbitant rent.\",\n          \"personal finance in new york is wild. i have friends who make a lot of money and can technically afford to live in apartments that are expensive, but probably shouldn\\u2019t. my friend who probably makes the most money (and has a rare two story apartment) also has significant credit card debt they don\\u2019t have plans to pay off fully and no real retirement savings. i\\u2019m convinced that most of the city is pretty bad at money in favor of keeping up with the joneses. i can afford $5k as a software engineer  but i will never nyc is a hub for finance jobs (investment banking, private equity) and tech jobs at the big companies (meta and google in particular have large nyc presence).   hence why there's so many people with large budgets. yo forreal there\\u2019s a wide range between affording $3k and affording $5k; per standard reqs, that equates to respective salaries of $120k and $200k   i can \\u201cafford\\u201d $4k, technically speaking, but i actually pay $2k  i do accounting, and i bartend; dollar-for-dollar, i earn about the same per hour at both jobs  yes, we are hiring accountants; no, we are not hiring bartenders work in marketing/ad tech. i can technically afford 4k in rent but choose not to, currently paying 1750 in a rent-stabilized studio. could contemplate up to maybe 2.5-3k to upgrade to a nicer 1 bedroom but that's a big maybe and would have to depend on the apartment! software engineer, big tech. i could afford 5.5k a month based on the 40x rule but that seems outrageous so capped myself at 3.5k  edit: comments locked so can\\u2019t reply but i had 1 yoe when i got my current job. i did however do 5 internships before my last job. attorney and i can barely cover my rent though it\\u2019s possible. software the people that i know who afford such apartments went to top universities, had almost perfect gpas, got the right internships, and now work for big tech companies or hedge funds, private equity, investment banking. or have rich parents.   unfortunately it\\u2019s pretty rare to be able to afford such a place outside those circumstances. tech sales. they are always hiring but you start at the bottom (well worth the easy life) if it's not a tech worker couple, a tech worker from an ivy school, or an institutionalized tech worker, then it's a lawyer, doctor, or finance slave family money and/or international money not worth   you get a better return investing those funds into smart stocks i work in marketing everyone i know who lives in that price range has minimum 2 roommates tech, finance, law, medicine, lots of career paths to $200k+. not a secret, you do well in school and you put in the work.

they are one of the biggest families too. they also have a brokerage scam running to collect broker fees even though they have a leasing office my last place was with bronstein managment and they def weren’t as bad as all the places here, but i wouldn’t recommend them. the super was mostly awol and never responded to maintenance requests (my shower took 15 min to get warm) and the management office is a mess—they tried to charge me rent the month after i moved out bc they never realized my lease ended and that i sent them a vacancy notice, it’s taken them 2 months to give me my security deposit back. the lobby was also dirty and packages kept getting stolen. the apartment itself was perfectly nice and was recently renovated, but it felt like they had no interest in maintaining the building arthur pinkus - has a property in harlem.   when i complained about big roaches in my apartment, he gaslighted me into saying it’s normal living in nyc. he hired the cheapest exterminator possible to shut me up and “treat” the building, which sort of helped but not really. come to find out, the roaches are coming from my filthy neighbors upstairs that have been living there forever. he also threatened to evict me because of the “constant complaining”.  you cannot exercise your rights as a tenant to him without getting upset and gaslighting you. not worth the headache. feel like this should be made into a post or google sheet with all these and pinned in this thread so people can run down the list before renting abeco management took a month to get my security deposit back. they pretty much ghosted me until i threatened with court 567 w 173 st!

i rented from them in bed stuy for a little over two years and only recently escaped from that apartment, which had no windows or ventilation in any common space. roommates didn’t disclose a history of black mold in the bathroom ceiling and vents, because the landlord had just painted over it for the third time…it ended up coming back within 6 months, and it took me a solid five months of bullying highview before they came by to actually replace the ceiling.   their office staff is maliciously incompetent, and i caught them in so many friggin lies over the last year that i lived there. ended up leaving due to life events shortly renewing the lease for a second time and was told to “just get a sublet.” when i told them i wanted to go through a proper lease changeover as outlined in the lease so i could have a clean break from the apartment, they waited until the last possible moment to go through their paperwork, and then emailed me what was basically a handmade sublet agreement because they “didn’t feel like doing the paperwork.”  that moldy apartment was a major reason i had incredibly poor health for the last year and a half, and most likely contributed to my pet’s death. i wish them ill. “sol” at “soloman management” (though he is probably had shuffled around the name) is an absolute scumbag. classic fake luxury property with a flooded basement full of mold he painted over (flooded 4 times while i lived there) - when we moved in the fridge was full of rotten black liquified food.   many other issues - then he tried to duck me on my whole deposit. i was attempting to sue him but he wouldn’t even provide a last name , which i never got. found his office and had to show up there to shake him down and he folded like a dog with his tail between his legs after i chewed him out in front of all his colleagues and cut me a check.   he mostly rents in bushwick and ridgewood https://www.openigloo.com/ great thread! we are compiling one specific to brooklyn :) wouldn’t it be easier to make a list of the landlords that we should rent from. 😂 [removed] david eisenberg at compass (broker) works with slumlords and will ruin your life while demanding an exorbitant fee. esteban marquez dny management llc. jennifer novelli. tried threatening us with the law but i did a 180° on her and said actually this is the law and technically you broke them. yes our building was pre war and old and renovated, but it was also maintained very poorly; terrible plumbing, never responded to many of our maintenance requests, and obviously, would try to bully us to many things, and gave everyone an “eviction” notice (idk what its called to not offer a renewal) less than 90 days even though we we’ve all lived there for 2+ years. one roommate was there since covid, so everyone was scrambling to get themselves prepared to move out in less than a month.   got our partial deposits shortly after that. my roommates were awful but i’ll never let anybody fuck with their money. keith mclaurin. had his own grandmother living in a moldy-ass apartment below us. dude still owes me $600. liberty enterprises inc. owned by gerald musano. also the realty group they work with - rent manhattan. scam scam scam. i haven’t lived in one of their buildings since 2015 and it still gets me fired up 😂 brodsky- 420 west 42nd st is an absolute shitshow! joyland management in brooklyn was hell to work with. they bought my building and i had to fight tooth and nail for several months after moving out to get my deposit back after being ghosted several times by their account manager jeanette. the only thing that got the ball rolling were threats to take them to small claims.  the cherry on top was that she and the other workers at the office felt like they were in the right and proceeded to curse me out as i was leaving the building. 10/10 experience total joke of a company. bill lika in brooklyn, williamsburg area.   front door of one of his buildings shocked us when we touched the door handle. had a current going through it. refused to pay rent until he fixed it and he threatened to evict us.   building was a piece of shit. ceilings leaked when it rained and water bubbles in the walls. his fix was painting over it and using spackle. also painted over mold stains.   our bathroom ceiling also leaked when the upstairs neighbor used his shower. we told him about it and he never did anything about it.   fuck bill lika. his family are also awful people. sabet group. you won’t get your security back. took them to court, won our case, still not getting it back. several other previous tenants were at court suing them as well on our court date shine corporation (shine corporation https://g.co/kgs/ydjbavh) majesty management david habif j wasser!! joseph / joe fonseca livingston management services llc. if anything breaks, prepare for it to stay that way for a long time. if you got a gas leak or mold, double it. true management/robert silverblat and any building owned by hung pin hung they’re all scum lol they’re allowed to operate like this unchecked because nyers accept a “that’s just how it is” fucked up status quo so easily.     being fucked over for housing is not okay, it’s not normal! greenbrook partners, big real estate investment firm using old school harassment and neglect slumlord tactics to get long time tenants out. they use the name mcnam for the building management part of the firm and partner a lot with carlyle the private equity firm. see more info here [https://patch.com/new-york/parkslope/tenants-tackle-morally-reprehensible-landlord-park-slope](https://patch.com/new-york/parkslope/tenants-tackle-morally-reprehensible-landlord-park-slope) and [https://www.brownstoner.com/real-estate-market/greenbrook-landlord-tenant-harassment-brooklyn/](https://www.brownstoner.com/real-estate-market/greenbrook-landlord-tenant-harassment-brooklyn/) chuck schumer called them bloodsuckers and yet they're still thriving in the city the moinian group / columbus property management abington properties needs to be added settle living taco bell newday management avni realty in the bronx. my friend rented from barry baron and stuart baron. their ceiling caved - huge wet slabs of sheet rock  onto the bed - they could care less. a rodent of some kind lived in walls. mice constantly. a tenant who lived in one of buildings w an attack dog that bit delivery people - they sided with this tenant. they are selfish and unethical! macabre realty, in hindsight that was the first red flag. the main guy you gotta watch out for is danny/rahim siony depending on which name he'll give you. if you look up his name it comes up with the indictment records from when he was caught quite a few years back, but it seems like someone else took the fall because he's renting again in crown heights. will break into the apartment, intimidate tenants, refuse to fix things, and threaten you if you report him to 311 and retaliate by shutting off your utilities. i’m just graduated college and i’ll be moving out in a couple years. im not familiar with looking for apartments yet, but just in case when your looking, can’t you see who owns them, and compare it to the list juan lopez/johnny lopez/yanni lopez (all same guy) aka jj fulton realty corp. completely scummy guy who  1. did not pay any building utilities and they would get shut off constantly 2. ignored access requests from the city to view the bulging wall of the building next door, which ended up needing immediate emergency repair 3. locked a dog in the basement of the building for weeks, i think to keep the city from going down in the basement of the building to shut off the gas 4. constantly had workmen in the building doing unpermitted work chain smoking and welding with all the doors and windows closed  and much, much more!  he is currently being sued in a huge lawsuit for taking out a $7mill mortgage on all his properties and never paying it back. i think he might have already lost. i hope they throw the book at him. east realty aka galster management aka smrc the lebewohl family and their management company ranger management concord management. always have a million violations and have to file 311 reports to get anything “fixed.” the office never answers any emails or phones. absolute joke. david finger, 210 east 95th street tlv management in bushwick - they’re assholes and are wrongfully suing me richard casanas 73 w 82nd st. deposit stealer, general asshole. anyone associated with the green living management company. i would also throw in staying away from the apt 212 realty company jasco management hager management. moved out in july after a year and a half of ongoing nightmares. my ceiling leaked, my heat didn’t work. in september i had a bed bugs. in january i got rodent mites from the rodents in the walls, and had to toss 99% of my possessions and eventually move out. every textile had to be sent out and treated which racked a bill of $1300 that management refused to pay for even though entomologists at cornell identified it as the building’s infestation. nathan the manager at hager, agreed to break my lease if i paid for the laundry and if he used my security deposit for my last months rent. i was scheduled to move out july 31, until nathan called again demanding he wants me out a week early so they could “repaint” for the new tenant. about a couple weeks after i moved out (second week of august) his secretary called demanding rent for july. i explained to her nathan agreed to use my security deposit for july since the pandemic had me lose my job, and i had agreed to cover the cost of the laundry. (no income, also why i was moving out.) i asked why she waited an entire month before calling about this issue and that nathan indeed agreed to use my security deposit for july. she yelled “well then take it up with him!” and abruptly hung up on me. i never got a call from nathan so i’m assuming he realized he’s not losing any money since he used my security deposit and a new tenant moved in two days after i moved out. hager management is greedy, shady, will not give a crap about the condition of their apartment buildings. do not move into their buildings and if you do, make sure you report everything to 311. when i started doing that i’d get threatening calls from nathan stating “we don’t do that here. we deal with it internally”. no you don’t. you just don’t want to get fined for having people live in inhabitable places. seth miller/aegis realty. crown heights & the bronx. i pray for his death avoid any buildings from nieuw amsterdam property management or the orbach group (specifically on the uws).   my roommate and i had to get the city involved in order to get our lease broken. the apartment building we were renting in should be condemned. ultimately we were able to get a vacate order issued which forced management to let us out of our lease.   there is an absolutely devastating [nyt article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/05/20/nyregion/nyc-affordable-housing.html) about slum lords in nyc which heavily featured not only my landlord but my apartment unit.  the tldr is that our apartment was infested with roaches, spiders, and rodents. we could not keep any food in the apartment because of the roaches. they were even inside the fridge. management refused to help us. in our attempts to get help we started to suspect our apartment was illegal (which ended up being true).  2 weeks after the city ordered a vacate notice on our unit and we moved out, they had already rented out our apartment to a new unsuspecting couple. wmw realty is the absolute worse arnold rosenshein (park slope) is shady af w deposits/front door safety issues but actually keeps apts clean and things are fixed. luke warm no.   also he splits his time btwn the hamptons ues and palm beach l m a o prasad management llc — landlord is impossible to get in contact with and the super in my building is the laziest man i have ever known. national grid had to turn off our stove’s gas line because our oven’s pilot light wasn’t lighting and was just leaking gas out into the apartment. it took over a month for them to bring someone to replace the pilot light, which took all of five minutes. my fiancé called the management office to complain about the super not coming and the response he got was “well, what do you want him to do about it?” maybe his job?  eta — our apartment was renovated before we moved in but it was done on the cheap. the tiles in our kitchen are so cheap and flimsy that i dropped a bottle of olive oil while making dinner one night, fully expecting the bottle to break, only to realize that the tile had cracked, not the bottle. hello i worked at housing court and i can say the majority of our cases were from a few landlords/companies. specifically i remember a lot of cases with renaissance equity holding and with any landlord or llc with a mailing address at 199 lee ave, i think several landlords have mailing addresses rheee menashe battat in hell’s kitchen. he owns a few apts in the atelier, i believe brooklyn too. very inappropriate behavior, but the only one that really affected me is when he paid my deposit back in installments 😑\n",
